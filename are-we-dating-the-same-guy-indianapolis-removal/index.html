        <p>It's Saturday night and you've just left a bar in Broad Ripple when your phone lights up with a screenshot from a friend. Your name and photo are in the Indianapolis "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group. The post alleges you're a compulsive liar who leads women on then disappears. Over a hundred comments are already piling up. Women are tagging friends, sharing screenshots, and several say they recognize you from Hinge. Indianapolis AWDTSG removal just went from something you've never heard of to the most important search of your life.</p>

<p>Indianapolis is a big city that feels like a small town, and that characteristic makes AWDTSG posts uniquely destructive here. The social circles around Mass Ave, Fountain Square, Broad Ripple, and Carmel overlap constantly. Everyone seems to know everyone. A single false post reaches through these networks like wildfire.</p>

<h2>The Indianapolis AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The Indianapolis "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group has over ten thousand members and is one of the most active groups in the Midwest. This group has 10,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly. You can find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/479657263920050/">facebook.com/groups/479657263920050/</a>. All posts are subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The group draws from the entire Indianapolis metro — from Fishers and Carmel in Hamilton County to Greenwood and Franklin to the south, from Avon and Brownsburg to the west to the growing Noblesville area. Indianapolis's position as Indiana's dominant city means the group effectively covers the state's largest dating pool.</p>

<p>Indianapolis's dating scene concentrates around specific neighborhoods that create natural social overlap. Mass Ave, Fountain Square, Broad Ripple, and the Wholesale District form the core dating corridors. A post in the Indianapolis AWDTSG group doesn't just reach random Facebook users — it reaches women who frequent the same restaurants, attend the same concerts at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, and work in the same downtown office towers.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Indianapolis AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 14,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Indianapolis</h2>

<p>Dating apps dominate the Indianapolis market, with Hinge and Bumble leading the pack. Indianapolis's growing tech sector and young professional population have made the dating app culture especially active. Weekend social scenes at spots along Mass Ave, Fountain Square's art walks, and Broad Ripple's nightlife create in-person connections that feed back into the AWDTSG ecosystem.</p>

<p>The spread pattern in Indianapolis follows the city's community structure. Screenshots get shared through Hamilton County mom groups, forwarded in Broad Ripple social circles, and discussed at downtown happy hours. Content often migrates to <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App</a>, Instagram DMs, and Reddit's Indianapolis forum.</p>

<p>Indianapolis's AWDTSG group also crosspollinates with groups in Cincinnati, Louisville, and Chicago. Women who travel I-65 and I-74 corridors for dating or social events share content across state lines. A post targeting you in Indianapolis can appear in neighboring city groups within a day, multiplying the damage far beyond the Circle City.</p>

<h2>Indiana Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Indiana provides clear legal protections against defamation. <a href="https://iga.in.gov/laws/2024/ic/titles/34#34-15">Under Indiana Code § 34-15-1-1 and related statutes</a>, defamation occurs when someone publishes a false and defamatory statement about another person to a third party. Indiana courts recognize both libel (written defamation, including social media posts) and slander.</p>

<p>Indiana recognizes defamation per se for false statements imputing criminal conduct, a loathsome disease, serious misconduct in one's profession, or unchastity. Many accusations in Indianapolis's AWDTSG group fall within these per se categories, meaning you don't need to prove specific financial damages — the law presumes harm from the nature of the false statements themselves.</p>

<p>Indiana's legal framework creates effective leverage for <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional Facebook defamation removal services</a>. Legal demands citing Indiana's specific defamation statutes route through Facebook's compliance channels, producing results that the standard reporting button never achieves.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Indianapolis AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>You've already tried clicking "Report Post" on Facebook. The result was either a rejection or radio silence while the post continued accumulating views and comments from women across Indianapolis. That's the typical experience, and it's exactly why professional removal services exist.</p>

<p>Here's how professional AWDTSG removal works for Indianapolis clients:</p>

<li><strong>Full documentation</strong> — We locate and catalog the original post, all comments and reactions, shares to other groups, and any cross-platform spread</li>
<li><strong>Indiana-specific legal preparation</strong> — Our team drafts removal demands citing Indiana Code defamation provisions and documenting the specific false claims</li>
<li><strong>Facebook legal channel routing</strong> — Documentation enters Facebook's legal compliance review, completely bypassing standard community moderation</li>
<li><strong>Regional cleanup</strong> — We track and address spread to Louisville, Cincinnati, Chicago, and other nearby AWDTSG groups</li>
<li><strong>Post-removal monitoring</strong> — Indianapolis's tight social scene means we watch for reposts and new mentions</li>

<p>Most Indianapolis AWDTSG removals complete within 30 to 90 days with success rates between ninety-two and ninety-five percent. Indiana's defamation per se framework gives the legal documentation teeth that standard Facebook reports completely lack.</p>

<h2>Indianapolis Career and Professional Impact</h2>

<p>Indianapolis is a hub for pharmaceutical companies (Eli Lilly), motorsport organizations, financial services, healthcare systems (IU Health, Community Health Network), and a growing tech sector. For Indianapolis professionals, online reputation directly affects career prospects, client relationships, and professional advancement.</p>

<p>A false AWDTSG post that accuses an Indianapolis professional of dishonesty, manipulation, or predatory behavior creates risks well beyond dating. HR departments Google candidates. Clients vet service providers. Professional networks run background checks. In Indianapolis's professional community — particularly in regulated industries like pharmaceuticals and finance — these false accusations can derail careers.</p>

<p>Our Indianapolis AWDTSG removal service provides complete protection across all platforms, ensuring defamatory content is removed from Facebook, cleaned from cross-platform spread, and deindexed from search engines. Your professional reputation in Indianapolis is too valuable to leave exposed.</p>



<h2>Indianapolis Area Service Coverage</h2>

<p>Our Indianapolis AWDTSG removal services cover the entire Indianapolis metropolitan area (population 2.1M metro) including surrounding communities. The Indianapolis area code (317) and ZIP codes starting with 46201 define the core service area. Local neighborhoods and communities including Mass Ave, Broad Ripple, Butler University, Fountain Square, Carmel all fall within the coverage area for our Indianapolis AWDTSG removal service.
