        <p>Maine's small population and close-knit communities make AWDTSG posts disproportionately damaging. In a state where Portland's dating scene is the center of gravity and everyone seems connected by just a degree or two of separation, a false post in a Maine "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group becomes community knowledge almost instantly. There's nowhere to blend in, no anonymous crowd to disappear into.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in a Maine AWDTSG group, the intimate nature of Maine's communities means the people seeing those accusations are likely people you know. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. Professional removal with ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates is the fastest path to protection.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Maine</h2>

<p>Maine's AWDTSG groups reflect the state's concentrated population centers, with Portland anchoring the network.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Portland/Southern Maine</strong> — The largest Maine group covering Portland, South Portland, Scarborough, Westbrook, and the Southern Maine corridor that extends to Biddeford and Saco</li>
<li><strong>Bangor</strong> — Serving central and northern Maine communities</li>
<li><strong>Lewiston/Auburn</strong> — Covering the Twin Cities area and Androscoggin County</li>
<li><strong>Augusta</strong> — Serving the state capital and Kennebec Valley</li>
<li><strong>Brunswick/Bath</strong> — Covering the Midcoast region</li>

<p>Portland's status as Maine's social and cultural hub means the Portland AWDTSG group captures the vast majority of the state's dating activity. The Old Port, East End, and West End neighborhoods anchor Portland's dating and nightlife scene, and posts frequently reference specific venues in these areas.</p>

<p>Maine's seasonal tourism adds complexity. Summer visitors and seasonal workers join local groups and carry information back to groups in Boston, New York, and other New England cities. This cross-regional spreading is particularly acute during peak tourist season.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Maine Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Maine has 3 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 1.4M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.


<h2>Maine Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Maine provides solid defamation protections through its statutory and common law framework. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong><a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/14/title14sec556.html">Maine Revised Statutes Title 14</a>, § 556</strong> sets the statute of limitations for defamation at <strong>two years</strong> from the date of publication. Maine follows common law defamation principles recognizing both libel and slander.

<p>Maine recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their business, trade, or profession</li>
<li>Impute unchastity or sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, damages are presumed. Most AWDTSG posts qualify under these categories.</p>

<strong>Maine Revised Statutes Title 17-A, § 506-A</strong> addresses harassment, including electronic communications used to harass, torment, or threaten. Targeted AWDTSG campaigns may constitute criminal harassment under Maine law.

<p>Maine courts recognize <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> claims, including false light publicity and public disclosure of private facts. These torts provide additional legal tools when AWDTSG posts share private information or create misleading impressions.</p>

<strong>Maine's constitutional privacy protections</strong> under Article I, Section 5 of the Maine Constitution add further legal weight to removal demands involving unauthorized exposure of private information.

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Maine</h2>

<p>Our Maine removal process accounts for the state's small-community dynamics where personal impact is maximized.</p>

<strong>Small-State Strategy.</strong> In Maine, we assess both online and real-world community damage, understanding that the overlap between online and offline networks is nearly complete in smaller markets.

<strong>Maine Legal Documentation.</strong> Our demands cite Title 14, § 556 and applicable per se categories, along with harassment and privacy protections.

<strong>New England Regional Monitoring.</strong> Maine posts frequently spread to Boston, New Hampshire, and other New England AWDTSG groups. We track and address this regional spreading.

<strong>Seasonal Monitoring.</strong> Tourist season creates temporary spikes in group activity and cross-regional spreading. We monitor for seasonal content migration.

<strong>Complete Cleanup.</strong> Facebook removal, cross-platform tracking, Google deindexing, and ongoing monitoring. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<p>Most Maine removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>

<h2>Maine Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14 § 753, Maine provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Maine recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Maine courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in ME county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14 § 753 and applicable Maine case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
