        <p>Two platforms dominate the landscape of online dating reputation: AWDTSG Facebook groups and the Tea App. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. If you've been posted on either — or both — understanding how each works is essential for effective removal. These platforms operate differently, spread content through different channels, and require distinct approaches to address.</p>

<p>This guide breaks down both platforms so you can make informed decisions about protecting your reputation.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG: The Facebook Group Network</h2>

<p>"Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups are city-specific Facebook communities restricted to women-only membership. They operate within Facebook's ecosystem, which means they're governed by Facebook's terms of service and moderation policies.</p>

<strong>How AWDTSG works:</strong>
<li>Women join their local city group after passing screening questions</li>
<li>Members post photos of men (usually from dating app profiles) with questions or warnings</li>
<li>Other members respond with their own experiences or information</li>
<li>Groups are closed — content is only visible to approved members</li>
<li>Membership ranges from 5,000 to 164,000+ depending on the city</li>

<strong>Content characteristics:</strong>
<li>Posts are tied to the poster's Facebook identity (though profiles can be minimal)</li>
<li>Comments create thread-style discussions that can grow to hundreds of responses</li>
<li>Group admins moderate with varying levels of attention</li>
<li>Content lives within Facebook's infrastructure</li>

<strong>Spread pattern:</strong>
<li>Screenshots get shared to Instagram Stories, private messages, Reddit, and Twitter</li>
<li>Content crosses between city-specific groups when members belong to multiple groups</li>
<li>Facebook's algorithm surfaces high-engagement posts to more group members</li>
<li>Original posts stay within the closed group, but copies spread everywhere</li>

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up, more people see it.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, exposure compounds fast. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.


<h2>Tea App: The Standalone Platform</h2>

<p>Tea App is an independent mobile application designed specifically for sharing anonymous reviews about people, with a heavy focus on dating experiences. Unlike AWDTSG, Tea App isn't part of any major social media platform.</p>

<strong>How Tea App works:</strong>
<li>Users download the app and create an account</li>
<li>Anyone can search for a person by name and read existing reviews</li>
<li>Users post anonymous reviews about individuals they've encountered</li>
<li>Reviews include ratings, text descriptions, and sometimes photos</li>
<li>Content is publicly accessible — no group membership required</li>

<strong>Content characteristics:</strong>
<li>Reviews are anonymous, making poster identification difficult</li>
<li>Content is structured (ratings, categories) rather than free-form like AWDTSG</li>
<li>No comment threads — reviews stand alone</li>
<li>Content is indexed by search engines because it's publicly accessible</li>

<strong>Spread pattern:</strong>
<li>Google indexes Tea App content directly — reviews appear in search results for your name</li>
<li>Screenshots get shared to social media just like AWDTSG content</li>
<li>The app's public nature means anyone can view reviews without an account</li>
<li>Cross-referencing between Tea App and AWDTSG is common — someone posted in one often gets posted in the other</li>

<h2>Key Differences That Affect Removal</h2>

<p>Understanding the structural differences between these platforms is critical for developing an effective removal strategy.</p>

<h3>Visibility and Access</h3>

<strong>AWDTSG:</strong> Closed groups mean content is theoretically contained. In practice, screenshots leak constantly, but the original post is only visible to group members. This creates a strange dynamic where you can't see what's being said about you, but thousands of women can.

<strong>Tea App:</strong> Fully public content that anyone can view. Your reviews are visible to potential dates, employers, friends, and family without any barrier. Google indexes this content, meaning it appears in search results for your name. In terms of raw searchability, Tea App is often more immediately damaging.

<h3>Poster Accountability</h3>

<strong>AWDTSG:</strong> Posters use their Facebook profiles, which provides at least some identifying information. In defamation cases, subpoenaing Facebook for poster identity is a well-established legal process. However, some posters use minimal profiles that reveal little.

<strong>Tea App:</strong> Reviews are anonymous by design. Identifying the poster requires legal action against Tea App itself, requesting account information associated with the review. This process is more complex because the platform is designed around anonymity.

<h3>Moderation Approach</h3>

<strong>AWDTSG:</strong> Group admins handle moderation with wide variation in standards. Some admins remove clearly false posts; others maintain a strict "believe all women" policy that keeps posts up regardless of evidence. The quality of moderation depends entirely on who runs your local group.

<strong>Tea App:</strong> The platform has its own content moderation policies and a reporting system. Response times and removal standards vary. Because Tea App is a dedicated company rather than a volunteer-run Facebook group, there are established channels for content disputes — though results are inconsistent.

<h3>Legal Leverage</h3>

<strong>AWDTSG:</strong> Defamation claims target the individual poster. Facebook's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">Section 230</a> protection means the platform itself isn't liable for user content. However, Facebook is required to respond to valid <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA</a> takedown notices for copyrighted images. Learn about your <a href="/blog/awdtsg-defamation-legal-rights">legal rights with AWDTSG posts</a>.

<strong>Tea App:</strong> Similar legal framework applies — the platform has Section 230 protection, but individual reviewers don't. The challenge is identifying anonymous reviewers through legal discovery. Tea App's terms of service and content policies provide additional avenues for removal requests.

<h2>When You're Posted on Both Platforms</h2>

<p>It's increasingly common for men to discover they've been posted on both AWDTSG and Tea App simultaneously. The crossover happens because:</p>

<li>Active users of one platform often use both</li>
<li>Screenshots from AWDTSG get converted into Tea App reviews</li>
<li>Someone who wants to maximize damage posts on every available platform</li>
<li>Content that goes viral on one platform attracts posts on the other</li>

<p>When you're dealing with both platforms, the removal complexity multiplies. Different methods work for each platform. Screenshots may have spread from both sources to third-party platforms. Search engines may be surfacing content from Tea App while AWDTSG screenshots appear on Reddit.</p>

<p>This is exactly why <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">comprehensive removal services</a> that address both platforms simultaneously produce the best outcomes. Removing an AWDTSG post while leaving Tea App reviews untouched — or vice versa — leaves significant reputation damage in place. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a> found 41% of Americans have experienced online harassment.</p>

<h2>Removal Strategies by Platform</h2>

<h3>AWDTSG Removal Approaches</h3>

<li><strong>Facebook reporting:</strong> Low success rate (5-10%) but free and worth attempting</li>
<li><strong>DMCA for your photos:</strong> Moderate success (40-60%) when you own the image copyright</li>
<li><strong>Admin contact:</strong> Risky — often backfires but occasionally works with reasonable admins</li>
<li><strong>Legal demand letters:</strong> Effective when the poster is identifiable and claims are provably false</li>
<li><strong>Professional services:</strong> Highest success rate (92-95%) with <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">proven methods</a></li>

<h3>Tea App Removal Approaches</h3>

<li><strong>In-app reporting:</strong> Moderate success for clear policy violations</li>
<li><strong>Terms of service violation claims:</strong> Can work for demonstrably false reviews</li>
<li><strong>Legal demand letters to Tea App:</strong> More structured process than Facebook group moderation</li>
<li><strong>DMCA for photos:</strong> Similar to Facebook — works when you own the copyright</li>
<li><strong>Professional services:</strong> <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Specialized Tea App removal</a> achieves consistent results</li>

<h3>Cross-Platform Removal</h3>

<p>Regardless of the source platform, content spreads to:</p>
<li>Reddit (r/AreWeDatingTheSameGuy and city-specific subreddits)</li>
<li>Instagram Stories and posts</li>
<li>Twitter/X threads</li>
<li>Personal blogs and gossip sites</li>
<li>Google search results</li>

<p>Professional removal services address not just the source content but all downstream copies. This comprehensive approach is what distinguishes professional services from DIY attempts that only address one post on one platform.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Response</h2>

<p>Your optimal strategy depends on several factors:</p>

<strong>If posted on AWDTSG only:</strong> Focus on rapid removal before screenshots spread. Professional services are most effective. Document everything for potential legal action. Read our <a href="/blog/how-to-remove-awdtsg-post">step-by-step removal guide</a>.

<strong>If posted on Tea App only:</strong> Prioritize search engine deindexing since Tea App content shows up in Google. Professional services can address both the source review and search results.

<strong>If posted on both platforms:</strong> Comprehensive professional removal is strongly recommended. Attempting DIY removal on two platforms with different structures while managing cross-platform spread is exceptionally difficult. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact Tea App Green Flags</a> for a unified approach covering both platforms and all downstream spread.

<strong>If you're not sure where you've been posted:</strong> Start with a professional assessment. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Free consultations</a> include a comprehensive audit of your digital presence across AWDTSG groups, Tea App, search engines, and social media platforms.

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>AWDTSG and Tea App are different tools serving similar purposes, and they create different types of reputation damage. AWDTSG's closed groups generate rapid social spread through screenshots, while Tea App's public reviews create persistent search engine visibility. Both can devastate your dating life, professional reputation, and personal relationships.</p>

<p>The good news: content on both platforms can be removed. The key is using the right approach for each platform while simultaneously addressing cross-platform spread. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> that specialize in both AWDTSG and Tea App deliver the most comprehensive results in the shortest timeframe.</p>
