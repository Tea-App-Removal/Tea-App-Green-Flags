Posts in the 79,000-member LA group typically receive hundreds of comments within hours.

        <p>It started with a DM from a buddy: "Bro, check this out." A screenshot from the Los Angeles "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group. Your photo. Your first name. A wall of accusations you've never seen before — cheating, ghosting, worse. The comments are already at two hundred and climbing. Women across West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and the Valley are passing judgment on a version of you that doesn't exist. Welcome to the worst night of your life in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In a city built on image and perception, a false AWDTSG post doesn't just damage your dating life. It threatens everything. Los Angeles is where your professional reputation and your personal reputation are the same thing.</p>

<h2>The Los Angeles AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Los Angeles" Facebook group has over <strong>79,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, comment, or request removal directly. The group can be found at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/3205948139691054/">facebook.com/groups/3205948139691054/</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 79,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is the second-largest AWDTSG group in the country, and its reach extends across one of the most sprawling metro areas in America. Women dating in Silver Lake, Downtown LA, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, and the South Bay all overlap in this single group. The dating scene in Los Angeles is heavily app-driven — Hinge, Bumble, Raya, and The League dominate — and AWDTSG has become an unofficial background check for women before swiping right.</p>

<p>In the entertainment, tech, and creative industries that define Los Angeles, reputation is currency. A post in the LA AWDTSG group doesn't just cost you dates. It can cost you meetings, partnerships, and opportunities when someone Googles your name before a pitch session in Hollywood or a networking event in Venice.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Los Angeles AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 85,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Los Angeles</h2>

<p>Los Angeles's dating ecosystem is uniquely interconnected despite the city's sprawl. Women who live in the Westside often date men from the Valley, DTLA, or the South Bay. The dating pool crosses neighborhood lines constantly, which means an AWDTSG post in Los Angeles reaches an incredibly diverse and widespread audience.</p>

<p>The spread pattern in Los Angeles typically looks like this:</p>

<li><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> amplify the post to followers across LA's image-conscious social scene within hours</li>
<li><strong>Screenshots circulate</strong> through group chats spanning different LA neighborhoods and social circles</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to adjacent groups</strong> — Orange County, Inland Empire, and San Diego AWDTSG groups all share members with the LA group</li>
<li><strong>Industry gossip networks</strong> in entertainment, tech, and hospitality spread information independently of social media</li>
<li><strong>TikTok and Twitter/X discussions</strong> about LA dating culture frequently reference specific AWDTSG posts</li>

<p>Los Angeles has a culture of talking. The city's social fabric — from Soho House to rooftop bars in Hollywood — runs on reputation. A false post in the Los Angeles AWDTSG group becomes the kind of thing people mention casually at brunches in Los Feliz and happy hours in Culver City. The damage extends far beyond the Facebook group itself.</p>

<h2>California Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>California provides robust legal protections against defamation under Civil Code Section 45 (libel) and Section 46 (slander). For AWDTSG posts in Los Angeles, the relevant framework is libel — written defamation published to third parties.</p>

<p>Key aspects of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=45.&lawCode=CIV">California defamation law</a> for Los Angeles residents:</p>

<li><strong>Libel per se</strong> applies when the statement falsely accuses someone of criminal conduct, sexual misconduct, or behavior incompatible with their profession — no need to prove specific financial damages</li>
<li><strong>California's statute of limitations</strong> is one year from the date of publication</li>
<li><strong>General damages</strong> are presumed in libel per se cases, meaning emotional distress, reputational harm, and humiliation are compensable without itemizing specific losses</li>
<li><strong>California Civil Code Section 1708. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support.85</strong> provides additional protections against online harassment and the nonconsensual distribution of private information</li>
<li><strong>Section 230</strong> does not shield the individual poster — only the platform</li>

<p>These strong California protections give <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> significant legal leverage when pursuing removal on behalf of Los Angeles clients. Facebook's legal team takes California defamation claims seriously, which often accelerates the removal timeline.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Los Angeles AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Reporting the post yourself through Facebook's standard system won't work. The Los Angeles AWDTSG group's admins treat removal requests from men as confirmation that the post is legitimate. Attempting to contact the poster — directly or through a friend — typically triggers a second post documenting your "intimidation attempt," doubling the damage.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal</a> works differently for Los Angeles clients:

<strong>Assessment and Documentation</strong> — We map every instance of the post across the LA AWDTSG group, neighboring groups (Orange County, San Diego, Inland Empire), Instagram reposts, Reddit threads, and any Google-indexed content.

<strong>Legal Channel Approach</strong> — We prepare formal legal documentation under California defamation statutes and submit through Facebook's legal compliance channels, bypassing the standard reporting system that consistently fails.

<strong>Cross-Platform Cleanup</strong> — Los Angeles posts spread fast to visual platforms. We address Instagram screenshots, Twitter discussions, Reddit threads, and search engine results simultaneously.

<strong>Ongoing Monitoring</strong> — After successful removal, we watch the LA AWDTSG group and related platforms for reposting attempts.

<p>Our timeline for Los Angeles removals averages <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> with a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong>. The earlier you engage professional help, the smaller the footprint of damage across Los Angeles's interconnected social landscape.</p>

<p>For content that has spread to <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App</a> or other dating-focused platforms, we handle those removals as part of a unified strategy.</p>

<h2>Act Now — Los Angeles Doesn't Forget</h2>

<p>In Los Angeles, 79,000+ women have access to what's been posted about you. Every hour the post stays live, more screenshots are taken, more conversations happen at brunch spots across Los Angeles, and more people form opinions based on false accusations.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Los Angeles "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group:</p>

<li><strong>Have a trusted person screenshot everything</strong> — the post, all comments, the poster's profile if visible</li>
<li><strong>Do not engage with the poster or the group</strong> — any contact from you or a proxy will escalate the situation in Los Angeles's tight social circles</li>
<li><strong>Avoid posting about it on your own social media</strong> — this draws more attention and often leads to the post being reshared</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services now</a></strong> — time is the enemy in a group this large</li>

<p>Your reputation in Los Angeles is worth protecting. False AWDTSG posts can be removed. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start the removal process today</a>.</p>
