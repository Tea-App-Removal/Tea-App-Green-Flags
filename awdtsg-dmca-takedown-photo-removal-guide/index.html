    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a [DMCA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) takedown and how does it apply to AWDTSG photos?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a federal law that gives copyright holders the right to request removal of their copyrighted content from online platforms. If someone posts a photo you took — such as a selfie or a self-portrait — in an AWDTSG group without your permission, you own the copyright to that image and can file a DMCA takedown notice with Facebook demanding its removal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use DMCA to remove a photo someone else took of me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Generally no. Copyright belongs to the photographer, not the subject of the photo. If a friend, ex-partner, or professional photographer took the photo posted in AWDTSG, they hold the copyright — not you. You would need the photographer's cooperation to file a DMCA claim, or you would need to pursue removal through other legal avenues like right of publicity or privacy laws."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the success rate of DIY DMCA takedowns against AWDTSG posts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"DIY DMCA takedowns against AWDTSG posts succeed approximately 10% of the time. Common reasons for failure include incorrectly filled forms, inability to prove copyright ownership, the poster filing a counter-notice, Facebook's inconsistent processing, and the fact that DMCA only addresses the specific image — not the text or comments in the post. Professional services achieve approximately 92% success rates using comprehensive multi-channel strategies."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does a Facebook DMCA takedown take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Facebook typically responds to DMCA takedown requests within 3-10 business days. However, if the poster files a counter-notice, the process can extend to 14+ business days. If the claim is rejected or the photo is reposted, you'll need to file again. Professional removal services typically resolve AWDTSG cases completely within 30-90 days, addressing all copies and screenshots across platforms."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if the AWDTSG poster files a DMCA counter-notice?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If the poster files a counter-notice, Facebook will restore the photo within 10-14 business days unless you file a federal lawsuit and provide Facebook with proof of the court filing. This is where most DIY DMCA attempts fail — the poster simply counter-files and the photo goes back up. Professional services have strategies to prevent counter-notices from succeeding."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does a DMCA takedown remove the entire AWDTSG post or just the photo?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A DMCA takedown only removes the specific copyrighted image. The text of the post, all comments, and any other images you don't hold copyright to will remain. This means the defamatory content stays visible even if your photo is removed. For complete post removal, a comprehensive approach combining DMCA with other removal strategies is necessary."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I file a DMCA takedown for screenshots of my photos shared on other platforms?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. If screenshots containing your copyrighted photo have spread to Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, or other platforms, you can file separate DMCA takedown notices with each platform. Each platform has its own DMCA process and response timeline. Professional removal services track and address content across all platforms simultaneously."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What information do I need to file a DMCA takedown with Facebook?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You need your full legal name and contact information, a description of the copyrighted work (the photo), the URL or location of the infringing content, a statement of good faith belief that the use is unauthorized, a statement under penalty of perjury that you are the copyright owner, and your physical or electronic signature. Filing a false DMCA claim can result in legal liability."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it worth filing a DMCA takedown myself or should I hire a professional?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you took the photo yourself and the post hasn't spread widely, a DIY DMCA attempt costs nothing and may work. However, given the 10% success rate for DIY attempts versus 92% for professional services, most people find professional help more effective — especially when the post has spread to multiple platforms or the defamatory text needs to be addressed alongside the photo."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get in trouble for filing a DMCA takedown on my AWDTSG photo?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you legitimately own the copyright to the photo, filing a DMCA takedown is your legal right and carries no risk. However, filing a false DMCA claim — for example, claiming copyright on a photo someone else took — can expose you to liability under the DMCA's penalty of perjury provision. The poster could also pursue damages for a knowingly false claim. Always ensure you actually hold the copyright before filing."}}]}

        <p>Your photo is sitting in an AWDTSG group with tens of thousands of members, and you want it gone. You've heard about DMCA takedowns — the copyright claims that can force platforms to remove content. But does DMCA actually work against AWDTSG posts on Facebook? And if so, how do you file one correctly?</p>

<p>This guide covers everything you need to know about using DMCA copyright claims to remove your photos from Are We Dating the Same Guy groups: what the law actually says, when it applies, how to file, why most people fail, and when it makes sense to bring in professional help.</p>

<h2>What Is a DMCA Takedown?</h2>

<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a 1998 federal law that, among other things, gives copyright holders the ability to demand removal of their copyrighted works from online platforms. When someone uses your copyrighted content without authorization, you can send a formal "takedown notice" to the hosting platform — in this case, Facebook — and the platform is legally obligated to remove the content or risk losing its safe harbor protection under Section 512.</p>

<p>The DMCA was designed primarily for situations like pirated movies, stolen music, and plagiarized articles. But it also applies to photographs, and that's where it becomes relevant for AWDTSG posts.</p>

<strong>The key principle:</strong> if you took the photo, you own the copyright. If someone posts that photo in an AWDTSG group without your permission, you have a legal right to demand its removal.

<h2>How DMCA Applies to Photos in AWDTSG Groups</h2>

<p>When someone posts about you in an AWDTSG Facebook group, they typically include a photo. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. That photo usually comes from one of a few sources:</p>

<strong>Your dating app profile.</strong> If you took the photo yourself — a selfie, a self-timer shot, a photo taken with your own camera — you own the copyright. DMCA applies.

<strong>Your social media accounts.</strong> Same principle: photos you took of yourself that you posted to Instagram, Facebook, or other platforms are your copyrighted works. Someone reposting them in an AWDTSG group without permission is copyright infringement.

<strong>Photos taken by others.</strong> If a friend, family member, professional photographer, or your ex-partner took the photo, they hold the copyright — not you. You cannot file a valid DMCA claim on a photo you don't own the copyright to, even if you're the subject of the photo.

<strong>Screenshots of your profile.</strong> If someone screenshots your dating app profile or social media, the screenshot itself contains your copyrighted images. DMCA can still apply to the embedded copyrighted content within the screenshot.

<p>This distinction matters enormously. The single biggest reason DIY DMCA attempts fail against AWDTSG posts is that the person filing doesn't actually own the copyright to the image being used.</p>

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every day your photo stays in an AWDTSG group, it spreads further.</strong> Screenshots get shared, cached copies multiply, and removal becomes harder. We've removed photos and posts from 1,000+ AWDTSG groups with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.

<h2>Step-by-Step: Filing a DMCA Takedown with Facebook</h2>

<p>If you've confirmed that you own the copyright to the photo posted in an AWDTSG group, here's how to file a DMCA takedown with Facebook:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Locate the Infringing Content</h3>

<p>You'll need the specific URL of the AWDTSG post containing your photo. Since you can't access the group directly, you'll need a trusted contact who is a member to provide the direct link to the post. Without this URL, Facebook cannot process your request.</p>

<p>If the post has been screenshotted and shared to other platforms (Reddit, Instagram, Twitter), note those URLs as well for separate DMCA filings.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Gather Your Copyright Evidence</h3>

<p>Before filing, prepare:</p>

<li><strong>The original photo file</strong> with metadata intact (date taken, device information, location data if available)</li>
<li><strong>Proof of first publication</strong> — the original upload to your dating profile, social media account, or other platform with timestamps predating the AWDTSG post</li>
<li><strong>A clear description</strong> of the copyrighted work and how it's being used without authorization</li>

<h3>Step 3: Access Facebook's DMCA Reporting Tool</h3>

<p>Navigate to Facebook's Intellectual Property reporting page. You can access this through:</p>

<li>The Help Center → Intellectual Property → Report Copyright Infringement</li>
<li>Direct URL: facebook.com/help/intellectual_property</li>
<li>The report option on the specific post (if accessible)</li>

<p>Select "I found content that infringes my copyright" and follow the guided form.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Complete the Takedown Notice</h3>

<p>Your DMCA notice must include the following elements (all are legally required):</p>

<li><strong>Your full legal name and contact information</strong> — including mailing address, phone number, and email</li>
<li><strong>Identification of the copyrighted work</strong> — description of the photo and where it was originally published</li>
<li><strong>Identification of the infringing material</strong> — the URL of the AWDTSG post and a description of where on the page the infringing content appears</li>
<li><strong>A good faith statement</strong> — "I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law"</li>
<li><strong>An accuracy statement under penalty of perjury</strong> — "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner"</li>
<li><strong>Your physical or electronic signature</strong></li>

<h3>Step 5: Submit and Track</h3>

<p>After submission, Facebook assigns a reference number. Save this. Facebook's initial review typically takes 3-10 business days. You'll receive email updates on the status of your claim.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Prepare for a Counter-Notice</h3>

<p>If the poster receives notification of your DMCA claim, they have the option to file a counter-notice disputing your claim. This is where things get complicated — and where most DIY attempts ultimately fail.</p>

<h2>Why Most DIY DMCA Takedowns Fail Against AWDTSG</h2>

<p>The data tells a stark story: approximately 10% of self-filed DMCA takedowns against AWDTSG posts succeed. Here's why the other 90% fail:</p>

<h3>The Copyright Ownership Problem</h3>

<p>Many men filing DMCA claims don't actually own the copyright to the photo used in the AWDTSG post. If your ex-girlfriend took the photo, or if it was pulled from a group photo a friend shot, you can't claim copyright. Filing a DMCA on content you don't own copyright to is perjury — and some posters know this and will aggressively counter-file.</p>

<h3>The Counter-Notice Loophole</h3>

<p>Even when your DMCA claim is valid, the poster can file a counter-notice simply stating they believe they have the right to use the content. Once a counter-notice is filed, Facebook must restore the content within 10-14 business days unless you file a federal lawsuit and provide proof to Facebook. Most people aren't prepared to file a federal lawsuit over a Facebook post, so the content goes back up.</p>

<h3>Facebook's Processing Inconsistencies</h3>

<p>Facebook handles millions of DMCA requests. Automated systems do much of the initial review, and valid claims are sometimes rejected due to:</p>

<li>Incomplete form submissions</li>
<li>Failure to provide sufficiently specific URLs</li>
<li>Automated matching failing to connect the original to the copy</li>
<li>The AWDTSG group's privacy settings complicating Facebook's review</li>

<h3>DMCA Only Addresses the Image</h3>

<p>Even a successful DMCA takedown only removes the specific copyrighted image. The post text — "Stay away from this guy, he's a narcissist who love-bombs and then ghosts" — stays up. The comments, the engagement, the social proof of other women piling on — all of it remains. You've removed your face from the post, but the defamatory content linked to your name persists.</p>

<h3>Spread to Other Platforms</h3>

<p>By the time you file a DMCA with Facebook, screenshots may have already reached Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, and private group chats. Each platform requires a separate DMCA filing. Some platforms are faster than others — Reddit is relatively responsive to DMCA claims, while content shared via private messaging is nearly impossible to address.</p>

<h2>When DMCA Works Best</h2>

<p>Despite the challenges, there are scenarios where DMCA is an effective tool:</p>

<strong>You clearly took the photo yourself.</strong> Selfies with EXIF data showing your device, geolocation, and timestamp make ownership easy to prove.

<strong>The post is recent and hasn't spread.</strong> If you catch the post within 24-48 hours and it hasn't been screenshotted extensively, removing the image quickly can limit damage.

<strong>The photo is the primary content.</strong> Some AWDTSG posts are image-heavy with minimal text. Removing the photo effectively removes the post's impact.

<strong>You combine DMCA with other strategies.</strong> DMCA works best as one element of a comprehensive removal approach — alongside Facebook content policy reports, direct negotiation, and <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a>.

<h2>When DMCA Won't Help</h2>

<strong>You didn't take the photo.</strong> No copyright, no DMCA claim. Period.

<strong>The poster took the photo.</strong> If your ex took a photo of the two of you together and posted it, they hold the copyright.

<strong>The post is primarily text-based.</strong> Some AWDTSG posts use minimal imagery and focus on written allegations. DMCA doesn't address text content.

<strong>The content has spread widely.</strong> If screenshots are on ten different platforms and dozens of private group chats, DMCA whack-a-mole becomes impractical without professional assistance.

<strong>The poster is willing to counter-file.</strong> If you're not prepared to escalate to federal court, a counter-notice effectively neutralizes your DMCA claim.

<h2>Facebook's Internal DMCA Process</h2>

<p>Understanding how Facebook processes DMCA claims helps explain why success rates vary:</p>

<strong>Automated initial review.</strong> Facebook's systems check whether the claim meets basic formatting requirements and whether the reported content URL is valid. Many claims are rejected at this stage for technical reasons.

<strong>Manual review queue.</strong> Claims that pass automated screening enter a manual review queue. Facebook's IP team reviews the claim, checks ownership evidence, and makes a determination. During high-volume periods, this review can take weeks rather than days.

<strong>Notification to the poster.</strong> If the claim is approved, the poster receives notification that their content has been reported for copyright infringement and will be removed. The poster is given the option to file a counter-notice.

<strong>Content removal or restoration.</strong> If no counter-notice is filed within the designated period, the content is permanently removed. If a counter-notice is filed, Facebook restores the content unless the claimant provides proof of a filed federal lawsuit.

<strong>Repeat infringement tracking.</strong> Facebook tracks DMCA claims against accounts. Multiple valid claims can result in the poster's account receiving strikes or being disabled. This can be strategically valuable even if the initial claim doesn't result in permanent removal.

<h2>Common Mistakes That Kill Your DMCA Claim</h2>

<p>Avoid these errors that consistently lead to failed DMCA filings:</p>

<strong>Using a fake name or contact info.</strong> DMCA requires your real legal name and contact information. Using fake details invalidates the claim. Yes, this means the poster may learn your identity — but since they already posted about you by name, this is rarely an additional exposure risk.

<strong>Filing on photos you don't own.</strong> As discussed, this is both legally risky (perjury) and practically ineffective (Facebook's systems can sometimes detect ownership inconsistencies).

<strong>Not providing the specific URL.</strong> "My photo is in an AWDTSG group in Chicago" isn't sufficient. You need the direct link to the specific post.

<strong>Writing an emotional narrative instead of a legal notice.</strong> Facebook's DMCA form requires specific legal language and structured information. Writing a paragraph about how unfair the post is doesn't meet the statutory requirements.

<strong>Failing to preserve evidence.</strong> Before filing the DMCA, document everything — the post, comments, shares, the poster's profile. If your DMCA succeeds, the photo disappears, but you may need that evidence later for further legal action.

<strong>Not addressing screenshots.</strong> You successfully get the original photo removed from Facebook, but five copies exist on Reddit and three on Instagram. Without addressing the spread, the removal is incomplete.

<h2>Professional DMCA Removal: Why the Success Rate Jumps to 92%</h2>

<p>Professional removal services like <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Tea App Green Flags</a> don't just file a DMCA form and hope for the best. Here's what changes with professional involvement:</p>

<strong>Multi-channel approach.</strong> DMCA is one tool in a comprehensive strategy that includes Facebook content policy violations, privacy complaints, community standards enforcement, and direct engagement with group administrators.

<strong>Platform relationship expertise.</strong> Professional services understand how each platform processes DMCA claims and tailor filings to maximize approval rates. The language, evidence presentation, and follow-up cadence are optimized based on thousands of previous cases.

<strong>Counter-notice prevention.</strong> Through strategic filing approaches and timing, professional services significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful counter-notice.

<strong>Cross-platform tracking.</strong> Professionals monitor all platforms where content has spread and file coordinated removal requests simultaneously, preventing the whack-a-mole effect.

<strong>Escalation paths.</strong> When standard DMCA fails, professional services have additional tools: legal escalation, platform policy specialists, regulatory complaints, and negotiation strategies that aren't available to individuals.

<strong>Our track record speaks for itself:</strong> across 1,000+ AWDTSG and <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App removal</a> cases, we've achieved a 92-95% success rate with complete removal — not just the photo, but the entire post, comments, and cross-platform copies — typically within 30-90 days.

<h2>DMCA vs. Other Removal Strategies</h2>

<p>DMCA is one option in your removal toolkit. Here's how it compares:</p>

<p>| Strategy | Cost | Success Rate | Timeline | Removes Text? |</p>
<p>|----------|------|-------------|----------|---------------|</p>
<p>| DIY DMCA | $0 | ~10% | 3-14 days (if successful) | No |</p>
<p>| Facebook Community Standards Report | $0 | 5-10% | 1-7 days (if successful) | Yes |</p>
<p>| Lawyer Cease & Desist | $500-$2,000 | 30-50% | 2-8 weeks | Sometimes |</p>
<p>| Defamation Lawsuit | $15,000-$150,000+ | 60-80% | 6-24 months | Yes |</p>
<p>| Professional Removal Service | $300-$1,500 | 92-95% | 30-90 days | Yes |</p>

<p>For most people, a <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal service</a> offers the best combination of cost, speed, and effectiveness. If you want to try DMCA first as a free option, go for it — but have a professional service as your backup plan.</p>

<h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>

<p>If your photo is in an AWDTSG group and you want it removed:</p>

<li><strong>Determine if you own the copyright.</strong> Did you take the photo? If yes, DMCA is viable. If no, you need other strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Get the post URL.</strong> Ask a trusted contact who's a member of the group to provide the direct link.</li>

<li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Screenshot the post, comments, poster profile, and any copies on other platforms.</li>

<li><strong>Decide: DIY or professional.</strong> If you want to try DMCA yourself, follow the steps above. If you want the highest probability of complete removal, <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">contact our team</a> for a free consultation.</li>

<li><strong>Act fast.</strong> Every day the photo stays up, more screenshots circulate. Time is the enemy.</li>

<p>The DMCA is a powerful legal tool when used correctly. But for AWDTSG posts specifically, it works best as part of a comprehensive removal strategy rather than a standalone solution. Whether you file yourself or work with a professional, the important thing is taking action before the damage compounds.</p>
