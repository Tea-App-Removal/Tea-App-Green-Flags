    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"My ex-girlfriend posted about me in AWDTSG. What should I do first?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Do not contact your ex or respond to the post. Your first step is to preserve evidence by screenshotting the post, all comments, any shares, and your ex's profile. Document the date and time you discovered it. Then immediately contact a professional removal service — time is critical because every hour the post stays up means more people see it and more screenshots are taken."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it defamation if my ex posted about me in an AWDTSG group?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If the post contains false statements of fact — such as false accusations of violence, criminal behavior, STDs, or other specific claims that can be proven false — it constitutes defamation. Revenge-motivated posts are particularly strong defamation cases because the poster's malicious intent (desire for revenge) can be demonstrated through your relationship history and the timing of the post relative to the breakup."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does it matter that my ex knows the AWDTSG post is false?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, this is critically important. When a poster knowingly makes false statements, it establishes actual malice — the highest level of fault in defamation law. Actual malice opens the door to punitive damages, which can be significantly higher than compensatory damages. An ex who fabricates accusations out of spite has a much weaker legal position than someone who makes an honest mistake."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a restraining order against my ex for the AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Potentially, yes. If the AWDTSG post is part of a broader pattern of harassment — which often includes multiple posts, encouraging others to contact you, sharing the post across platforms, or combined with other harassing behavior — you may qualify for a restraining order or protective order. Many states now explicitly include electronic and social media harassment in their restraining order statutes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my ex used a fake account to post about me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Fake accounts do not provide anonymity from legal consequences. Your attorney can subpoena Facebook for account information, including IP addresses and associated email addresses. If you have evidence that your ex is the poster (timing, knowledge of private details, similar language patterns), this can support identification. Professional removal services also have methods for working with anonymous posts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My ex threatened to post about me in AWDTSG. Can I stop it preemptively?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your ex has threatened to post false information about you, preserve those threats as evidence. Written threats (texts, emails, social media messages) are powerful evidence of premeditated defamation. Your attorney may be able to obtain a temporary restraining order preventing the post. The threats themselves also establish actual malice if the post is eventually made."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can my ex be criminally charged for a revenge AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Depending on your state, criminal charges may be possible. If the post includes intimate images, revenge porn laws in over 45 states create criminal liability. Cyber harassment and cyberstalking statutes may apply if the post is part of a pattern. Anti-doxing laws may apply if personal identifying information was published with intent to harass. Consult with a local attorney about criminal options in your jurisdiction."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to remove an ex's revenge AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Professional removal services typically achieve removal within 30 to 90 days. Emergency cases involving active career threats, custody impacts, or ongoing harassment may receive expedited treatment. The timeline depends on factors including the specific group, the admin's responsiveness, and which removal pathways are most effective for your situation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I tell people the AWDTSG post was from my ex?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Be very strategic about this. Telling close friends and family the context can protect those relationships. However, publicly defending yourself or revealing the poster's identity can backfire — it may draw more attention to the post and can be used against you legally. Let professionals handle the removal and any public-facing communication. Your attorney can advise on when disclosure is strategic."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my ex keeps reposting after the first post is removed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Repeated posting after removal significantly strengthens your legal case. It demonstrates a clear pattern of harassment, establishes that the poster is acting with malice rather than genuine concern, and may qualify as stalking under many state laws. Document each repost. Your attorney can seek injunctive relief (a court order) prohibiting further posts, and repeated violations can result in contempt of court charges."}}]}

        <p>You just found out your ex-girlfriend posted about you in an "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group. Your stomach drops. Your heart races. You feel the rage, the betrayal, and the helplessness all at once.</p>

<p>You're not alone. <strong>Revenge-motivated posts from ex-girlfriends account for a significant portion of all AWDTSG cases we handle.</strong> These aren't posts from women genuinely trying to warn others about dangerous behavior — they're weaponized attacks by people who know you, who have access to your photos and personal details, and who are using a Facebook group as a weapon because the relationship ended in a way they didn't accept. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This guide is for you. Right now, in this moment. Here's exactly what's happening, why it's happening, and — most importantly — what you can do about it starting immediately.</p>

<h2>Why Exes Use AWDTSG for Revenge</h2>

<p>Understanding why your ex posted about you isn't just psychologically helpful — it's legally relevant. The motivation behind the post directly affects your legal options and the strength of your case.</p>

<h3>The Breakup Weapon</h3>

<p>AWDTSG groups have become the modern breakup weapon of choice. When a relationship ends badly — or even ends at all — some women turn to these groups as a way to:</p>

<li><strong>Punish you</strong> for ending the relationship or for how it ended</li>
<li><strong>Control the narrative</strong> by publicly establishing their version of events before you can speak for yourself</li>
<li><strong>Damage your dating prospects</strong> so you can't easily move on to a new relationship</li>
<li><strong>Generate validation and sympathy</strong> from thousands of strangers who only hear one side</li>
<li><strong>Exert power</strong> in a situation where they feel they've lost it</li>
<li><strong>Retaliate</strong> for perceived slights, real or imagined</li>

<p>The critical legal point: <strong>revenge is not a legitimate purpose for publishing false statements about another person.</strong> When a poster is motivated by spite rather than genuine concern for public safety, it dramatically weakens any defense they might raise and dramatically strengthens your legal claims.</p>

<h3>How Exes Weaponize Insider Knowledge</h3>

<p>What makes revenge posts from exes particularly damaging is the level of detail they can include. Unlike a stranger who went on one date with you, an ex has:</p>

<li><strong>Your photos</strong> — Including private photos, photos with friends and family, and photos in identifiable locations</li>
<li><strong>Personal details</strong> — Your workplace, neighborhood, social circles, routines, and habits</li>
<li><strong>Private information</strong> — Things you shared in confidence during the relationship</li>
<li><strong>Context manipulation</strong> — The ability to take real events out of context to create false impressions</li>
<li><strong>Emotional insight</strong> — Knowledge of what would hurt you most</li>

<p>This insider knowledge makes revenge posts more convincing, more damaging, and more likely to spread. But it also makes them more legally actionable — because it demonstrates that the poster had a personal relationship with you and a motive to cause harm.</p>

<h2>This Is an Emergency — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Your ex knows your name, your workplace, and your social circle. This post isn't just damaging your dating life — it's a direct threat to everything you've built.</strong> We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free emergency consultation now</a>.

<h2>Step-by-Step: What to Do Right Now</h2>

<p>The next 24 to 48 hours are critical. Here's exactly what to do, in order:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Do NOT Contact Your Ex</h3>

<p>This is the hardest step and the most important. Your instinct is to call, text, or message your ex and demand she take the post down. <strong>Do not do this.</strong></p>

<p>Why:</p>
<li>Any communication you send will be screenshotted and shared in the group as "proof" that you're aggressive, controlling, or harassing</li>
<li>Angry messages provide ammunition for restraining orders against you</li>
<li>Contact may be interpreted as intimidation, undermining your legal position</li>
<li>It tips off your ex that you know about the post, potentially leading her to screenshot and share it further before removal can happen</li>

<p>If your ex contacts you about the post, do not respond. Save the messages as evidence but do not engage.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Do NOT Engage with the AWDTSG Group</h3>

<p>Do not create a fake account to join the group. Do not have a friend post on your behalf. Do not comment anywhere about the post publicly. All of these actions backfire spectacularly. See our guide on <a href="/blog/posted-in-awdtsg-what-to-do">what to do when you're posted in AWDTSG</a> for a complete breakdown of why engagement always makes things worse.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Preserve All Evidence</h3>

<p>This is your most important defensive action. Preserve everything:</p>

<strong>The post itself:</strong>
<li>Full screenshot of the post including the poster's name/profile, timestamp, and all text</li>
<li>Screenshots of all comments and replies</li>
<li>Screenshots showing the number of reactions, shares, and comments</li>
<li>Screenshots of any shares to other groups or platforms</li>

<strong>Your ex's profile:</strong>
<li>Screenshot of your ex's Facebook profile (or the account that made the post)</li>
<li>Any evidence connecting a fake account to your ex (similar photos, mutual friends, writing style)</li>

<strong>Evidence of the relationship:</strong>
<li>Text messages showing the relationship context</li>
<li>Evidence that the breakup motivated the post (timing, prior threats)</li>
<li>Any messages where your ex threatened to post about you</li>

<strong>Evidence of falsity:</strong>
<li>Documentation that disproves specific claims in the post</li>
<li>Medical records if STD claims are made falsely</li>
<li>Police records (or lack thereof) if criminal accusations are made</li>
<li>Witness statements from people who can attest to the truth</li>

<strong>Damage documentation:</strong>
<li>Screenshots showing the post appearing in Google search results for your name</li>
<li>Evidence of the post being shared on other platforms</li>
<li>Any professional, personal, or financial impact you can document</li>

<p>Store evidence in multiple locations: cloud storage, email to yourself, and a physical USB drive.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Contact Professional Removal Immediately</h3>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> are your fastest path to getting the post taken down. At Tea App Green Flags, we begin working on your case immediately and achieve removal within 30 to 90 days with a 92-95% success rate.

<p>For revenge posts specifically, professional removal offers critical advantages:</p>
<li>We handle all communication so you don't have to interact with your ex or the group</li>
<li>Multiple removal pathways are pursued simultaneously</li>
<li>Your identity and strategy remain confidential</li>
<li>The removal doesn't require your ex's cooperation</li>

<h3>Step 5: Consult a Defamation Attorney</h3>

<p>Revenge posts create some of the strongest defamation cases because the element of malice is often provable through the relationship history. A defamation attorney can:</p>

<li>Send a cease and desist letter to your ex</li>
<li>Evaluate your case for a defamation lawsuit</li>
<li>Assess damages including emotional distress, career impact, and relationship harm</li>
<li>Advise on restraining order options</li>
<li>Subpoena Facebook if your ex used a fake account</li>

<p>Many defamation attorneys offer free initial consultations. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support. Understanding your legal options costs nothing and can provide peace of mind while removal is underway.

<h2>Why Revenge Posts Create Stronger Legal Cases</h2>

<p>If there's any silver lining to a revenge-motivated AWDTSG post, it's that these cases are legally stronger than random posts. Here's why:</p>

<h3>Knowingly False = Actual Malice</h3>

<p>The legal standard that most benefits AWDTSG defamation plaintiffs is <strong>actual malice</strong> — the poster's knowledge that the statements were false or reckless disregard for whether they were true.</p>

<p>With revenge posts, actual malice is far easier to prove because:</p>
<li><strong>Your ex knows the truth.</strong> She was in the relationship. She knows whether specific claims actually happened.</li>
<li><strong>Timing establishes motive.</strong> A post that appears days or weeks after a breakup clearly connects to the relationship ending, not genuine safety concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Prior threats are evidence.</strong> If your ex threatened to "ruin you" or "tell everyone about you," that's direct evidence of malicious intent.</li>
<li><strong>The relationship context is documented.</strong> Text messages, social media interactions, and mutual friends can all testify to the actual dynamics of the relationship versus what was posted.</li>

<p>Actual malice unlocks <strong>punitive damages</strong> — financial penalties designed to punish particularly egregious behavior. In revenge post cases, punitive damage awards can be three to five times higher than compensatory damages.</p>

<h3>Pattern of Harassment</h3>

<p>Revenge AWDTSG posts rarely occur in isolation. They're often accompanied by:</p>
<li>Multiple posts in different AWDTSG groups (your city, your workplace area, your college town)</li>
<li>Encouraging friends to add comments supporting the false claims</li>
<li>Sharing the post on other social media platforms</li>
<li>Direct harassment through text, email, or social media</li>
<li>Contact with your friends, family, or employer</li>

<p>This pattern strengthens both civil claims and potential criminal charges. Documentation of the broader harassment campaign is essential. Learn more about how <a href="/blog/awdtsg-screenshots-spread-platforms">AWDTSG screenshots spread across platforms</a>.</p>

<h3>Identifiable Poster</h3>

<p>Unlike anonymous AWDTSG posts where identifying the poster requires subpoenas and investigation, you know exactly who your ex is. This eliminates one of the most challenging and expensive aspects of defamation litigation — identifying the defendant. You have their name, contact information, and the full context of your relationship.</p>

<h2>Legal Options Specific to Revenge Posts</h2>

<h3>Defamation Lawsuit</h3>

<p>A defamation lawsuit against your ex can recover:</p>
<li><strong>Compensatory damages</strong> for lost income, damaged relationships, and emotional distress</li>
<li><strong>Special damages</strong> for specific financial losses (lost job, lost business, lost dating opportunities)</li>
<li><strong>Punitive damages</strong> when actual malice is proven (likely with revenge posts)</li>
<li><strong>Attorney's fees</strong> in some jurisdictions</li>
<li><strong>Injunctive relief</strong> — a court order requiring the post be removed and prohibiting future posts</li>

<p>For a detailed analysis of defamation claims against AWDTSG posters, see our guide on <a href="/blog/can-you-sue-awdtsg-post">whether you can sue for an AWDTSG post</a>.</p>

<h3>Restraining Order / Protective Order</h3>

<p>If the AWDTSG post is part of a broader pattern of harassment, you may qualify for a civil restraining order or protective order. Modern restraining orders in most states can:</p>
<li>Prohibit your ex from posting about you online</li>
<li>Require removal of existing posts</li>
<li>Prohibit your ex from contacting you through any means</li>
<li>Prohibit your ex from contacting your employer, friends, or family</li>
<li>Carry criminal penalties for violation</li>

<p>To obtain a restraining order, you typically need to demonstrate:</p>
<li>A pattern of harassment (the AWDTSG post plus other harassing conduct)</li>
<li>Reasonable fear of continued harm</li>
<li>That the harassment is targeted and intentional</li>

<p>Evidence of threats to post, the post itself, and any accompanying harassment all support a restraining order petition.</p>

<h3>Criminal Charges</h3>

<p>Depending on your state, your ex's revenge post may constitute criminal conduct:</p>

<strong>Cyber harassment / cyberstalking.</strong> Over 40 states criminalize online harassment — a widespread problem that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a> found affects 41% of Americans. A revenge AWDTSG post, particularly when combined with other harassing behavior, may qualify.

<strong>Criminal defamation.</strong> While uncommon, some states still have criminal defamation statutes that apply to knowingly false statements made with intent to harm.

<strong>Anti-doxing violations.</strong> If the post includes your workplace, address, or other identifying information published with intent to harass, <a href="/blog/is-are-we-dating-the-same-guy-legal">state anti-doxing laws</a> may apply.

<strong>Revenge porn.</strong> If the post includes intimate images shared during your relationship, over 45 states criminalize non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

<h3>Cease and Desist Letter</h3>

<p>A formal cease and desist letter from an attorney to your ex:</p>
<li>Puts her on legal notice that the statements are false and actionable</li>
<li>Creates a documented paper trail showing you formally objected</li>
<li>Establishes that continued publication is with full knowledge of your claims</li>
<li>Often motivates removal without the cost of full litigation</li>
<li>Demonstrates to courts that you attempted to resolve the matter before suing</li>

<h2>Protecting Your Career and Reputation</h2>

<p>Revenge AWDTSG posts pose a particular threat to careers because exes often include workplace information and professional details. For a comprehensive guide on career protection, see our <a href="/blog/awdtsg-career-job-impact-guide">AWDTSG career impact guide</a>.</p>

<p>Immediate career protection steps:</p>
<li><strong>Assess Google exposure</strong> — Search your name and see if the post appears</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen your professional online presence</strong> — Update LinkedIn, publish professional content</li>
<li><strong>Prepare a brief explanation</strong> in case an employer asks — keep it factual and unemotional</li>
<li><strong>Engage professional removal</strong> to eliminate the content before it causes career damage</li>
<li><strong>Consult an employment attorney</strong> if you've already suffered professional consequences</li>

<h2>Emotional Support and Self-Care</h2>

<p>Being posted in an AWDTSG group by someone you trusted is a betrayal that goes beyond professional damage. The emotional impact is real, and it deserves attention.</p>

<strong>What you might be feeling:</strong>
<li>Rage at the injustice and betrayal</li>
<li>Helplessness at not being able to defend yourself</li>
<li>Anxiety about who has seen the post</li>
<li>Depression and withdrawal from social situations</li>
<li>Paranoia about what people think when they look at you</li>
<li>Shame — even though you've done nothing wrong</li>

<strong>These feelings are normal.</strong> They are the natural response to having your reputation publicly attacked by someone you were vulnerable with. You are not weak for feeling them.

<strong>Resources that can help:</strong>
<li><strong>Therapy or counseling</strong> — A therapist who specializes in reputation-based trauma can provide tools for managing the emotional impact</li>
<li><strong>Support networks</strong> — Trusted friends and family who know the truth about your character</li>
<li><strong>Men's mental health resources</strong> — Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) provide confidential support</li>
<li><strong>Legal action as empowerment</strong> — For many men, taking concrete legal and removal steps provides a sense of agency that counteracts helplessness</li>

<strong>Do not let the emotional weight paralyze you into inaction.</strong> The single most effective thing you can do for your emotional wellbeing is to take action — engage professional removal, consult an attorney, and begin the process of reclaiming your reputation.

<h2>When Your Ex Escalates</h2>

<p>Some exes don't stop at a single AWDTSG post. They escalate. Be prepared for:</p>

<strong>Multiple posts.</strong> Your ex may post in several AWDTSG groups — your current city, your hometown, and cities where you have professional connections. Document each one.

<strong>Encouraging pile-ons.</strong> Your ex may recruit friends to add "confirming" comments to make the accusations seem more credible. These individuals may also face defamation liability.

<strong>Direct harassment.</strong> The AWDTSG post may be accompanied by texts, emails, showing up at your workplace, or contacting your family. All of this supports restraining order petitions and criminal charges.

<strong>Contacting your employer.</strong> Some vindictive exes directly contact your workplace with the accusations. Preserve any evidence of this — it may constitute tortious interference with your employment.

<strong>Reposting after removal.</strong> If a post is removed and your ex reposts it, this dramatically strengthens your legal case. It proves the harassment is intentional, ongoing, and malicious.

<p>Every escalation makes your legal position stronger. Document everything and let your attorney and removal service know immediately when new activity occurs.</p>

<h2>You Will Get Through This</h2>

<p>A revenge AWDTSG post feels like the end of the world. It's not. Men recover from this every day with the right support, the right strategy, and prompt action.</p>

<p>Here's what your recovery timeline looks like:</p>

<strong>Days 1-7:</strong> Evidence preservation, professional removal engagement, attorney consultation. The initial shock subsides as you take concrete action.

<strong>Days 7-30:</strong> Removal process underway, legal strategy developing, emotional support in place. You begin to feel a sense of control returning.

<strong>Days 30-90:</strong> Post removed with 92-95% success rate. Google deindexing of cached content. Legal claims progressing if pursued. Your online reputation begins to recover.

<strong>Days 90+:</strong> The post is gone. Your reputation is healing. If you've pursued legal action, your case is progressing toward resolution. You can move forward.

<strong>The most important thing you can do right now is take the first step.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact Tea App Green Flags</a> for a free, confidential emergency consultation. Tell us what happened. We'll tell you exactly how we can help.
