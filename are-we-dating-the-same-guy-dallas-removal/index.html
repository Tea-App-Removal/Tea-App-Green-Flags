The statute of limitations in Texas is one year from the date of publication."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do Dallas AWDTSG posts spread to Fort Worth and other Texas cities?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes.

        <p>You found the screenshot in a group chat. Your face, pulled from your Hinge profile, posted in the Dallas "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group alongside claims that would destroy anyone's reputation. Women across Uptown, Deep Ellum, and Highland Park are reading it. The comment section is a courtroom where you've already been convicted without a trial, and you can't even see the charges being filed. This is happening right now in Dallas, and you need to act.</p>

<p>Dallas is a city where reputation matters — in business, in church communities, in the social circles that define your professional and personal life. A false AWDTSG post in Dallas doesn't stay in the dating world. It bleeds into everything.</p>

<h2>The Dallas AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Dallas" Facebook group has over <strong>35,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, comment, or request removal. The group is at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/1378149729337459/">facebook.com/groups/1378149729337459/</a>. All content is subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a> and their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 35,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Dallas's AWDTSG group is one of the largest in Texas, reflecting the DFW metroplex's massive dating population. The group captures women dating across Dallas proper, Fort Worth, Plano, Frisco, Arlington, and the entire sprawling metro area. With Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder dominating the Dallas dating scene, AWDTSG has become the unofficial vetting system that women check before meeting up with a match.</p>

<p>The DFW metroplex is the fourth-largest metro area in the country. That means a post in the Dallas AWDTSG group reaches an enormous and diverse audience — from young professionals in Uptown to families in the suburbs of McKinney and Allen. The impact compounds because Dallas's business community and social community overlap significantly.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Dallas AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 48,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Dallas</h2>

<p>The DFW metroplex's size creates a unique spread pattern. Dallas and Fort Worth have distinct dating scenes that overlap heavily. Women living in Plano might date men in Dallas. Someone in Arlington might match with people in both cities. The AWDTSG group bridges all of these communities into a single audience.</p>

<p>The typical spread pattern in Dallas:</p>

<li><strong>Group chats among friend circles</strong> in Uptown, Knox-Henderson, and the Park Cities share screenshots within hours</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> circulate the post across Dallas's image-conscious social scene</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to Fort Worth, Austin, and Houston AWDTSG groups</strong> — Texas's dating pools overlap significantly between major cities</li>
<li><strong>Church and social community gossip</strong> — Dallas's strong faith and social communities create word-of-mouth networks that operate independently of social media</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn and professional circles</strong> — In Dallas's business-driven culture, reputation damage crosses the personal-professional boundary faster than in most cities</li>

<p>Dallas is a city that talks. From the Sunday brunch spots in Bishop Arts to the bars along Lower Greenville, social currency depends on reputation. A single false AWDTSG post can rewrite how Dallas sees you before you have any chance to respond.</p>

<h2>Texas Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Texas provides meaningful legal protections against defamation. Under the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) and common law defamation standards, individuals can pursue action against those who publish false statements of fact.</p>

<p>Key points about <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.73.htm">Texas defamation law</a> for Dallas residents:</p>

<li><strong>Defamation per se</strong> in Texas covers false accusations of criminal conduct, sexual misconduct, having a loathsome disease, and statements injurious to one's business or profession — no proof of special damages required</li>
<li><strong>Texas statute of limitations</strong> for defamation is one year from publication</li>
<li><strong>Texas courts</strong> recognize social media posts, including Facebook group posts, as sufficient publication for defamation claims</li>
<li><strong>The TCPA</strong> (Texas anti-SLAPP statute) may come into play, but it protects against frivolous lawsuits — not against legitimate defamation claims based on provably false statements</li>
<li><strong>Actual damages plus exemplary damages</strong> are available in Texas when the poster acted with malice</li>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> use Texas defamation law to create compelling legal documentation that accelerates the Facebook removal process for Dallas clients.

<h2>Professional Removal for Dallas AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Standard Facebook reporting fails for Dallas AWDTSG posts. The group's admins dismiss removal requests, Facebook's automated systems don't flag the content, and contacting the poster directly typically results in a second post documenting your "threatening" behavior. In Dallas's interconnected social world, a botched DIY removal becomes bigger news than the original post.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> approach Dallas cases systematically:

<strong>DFW-Wide Assessment</strong> — We map every instance of the post across the Dallas AWDTSG group, the Fort Worth group, other Texas city groups, Instagram shares, Reddit threads, and Google search results.

<strong>Texas Legal Framework</strong> — We prepare formal documentation under Texas defamation law, including references to defamation per se categories and the availability of exemplary damages, for submission through Facebook's legal compliance channels.

<strong>Comprehensive Platform Removal</strong> — We address the original post, all cross-platform instances, screenshots shared on other social media, and search engine indexing.

<strong>Ongoing DFW Monitoring</strong> — After removal, we monitor Dallas, Fort Worth, and DFW-area AWDTSG groups for reposting attempts.

<p>Dallas removals typically complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong>. The sooner professional removal begins, the less the post spreads across the vast DFW metroplex.</p>

<p>If the defamation has also appeared on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App</a>, we handle that removal in parallel.</p>

<h2>Dallas Doesn't Give You Time to Wait</h2>

<p>With 35,000+ members in the Dallas AWDTSG group and the DFW metroplex's sprawling reach, a false post reaches new audiences constantly. Every day it stays up, more women in Dallas save screenshots, share them in group chats, and mention them to friends. The damage in Dallas builds faster than you'd expect in a metro area this large.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Dallas "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group:</p>

<li><strong>Get documentation now</strong> — Have someone you trust screenshot the post, comments, and any identifiable information about the poster</li>
<li><strong>Do not contact the poster or the group admins</strong> — This backfires in virtually every Dallas case we've seen</li>
<li><strong>Be cautious about your social media activity</strong> — Going private is smart; posting about the situation is not</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services immediately</a></strong> — The first 48 hours determine how far the damage spreads across DFW</li>

<p>Your reputation in Dallas is worth fighting for. False AWDTSG posts can be removed professionally and effectively. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start the removal process today</a>.</p>
