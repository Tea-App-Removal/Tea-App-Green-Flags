    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue someone for emotional distress caused by an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. If an AWDTSG post has caused you significant emotional distress, you may have grounds for a lawsuit based on Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) or Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED), separate from or in addition to a defamation claim. IIED requires proving the poster engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally or recklessly caused you severe emotional distress. Courts have increasingly recognized online defamation as meeting this threshold."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between IIED and NIED in AWDTSG cases?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) requires proving the poster acted intentionally or recklessly to cause you severe distress through extreme and outrageous conduct. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED) requires proving the poster failed to exercise reasonable care and that their negligence foreseeably caused your emotional harm. IIED typically applies when the poster acted with malice or revenge, while NIED applies when the poster carelessly posted false information without considering the consequences."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I prove emotional distress from an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Courts look for documented evidence including therapy or counseling records, prescriptions for anxiety or depression medication, testimony from mental health professionals, personal journals documenting your emotional state, evidence of disrupted sleep or eating patterns, testimony from friends and family about observed behavioral changes, and records of missed work or reduced job performance. The stronger your documentation, the stronger your claim."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much can I recover in an emotional distress lawsuit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Emotional distress awards vary widely by jurisdiction and case specifics. Courts have awarded anywhere from $5,000 to over $500,000 for emotional distress claims related to online defamation. Factors include the severity of the distress, the duration of suffering, the egregiousness of the conduct, whether the poster acted with malice, and the extent of publication. Punitive damages may significantly increase the total award in cases involving intentional malice."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to see a therapist to sue for emotional distress?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While not always legally required, seeing a therapist or counselor significantly strengthens your emotional distress claim. A mental health professional's diagnosis and treatment records provide objective evidence of your distress. Courts give more weight to documented mental health impacts than to self-reported symptoms alone. Starting therapy also demonstrates that your distress was severe enough to require professional intervention."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I claim emotional distress even if the AWDTSG post has been removed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Emotional distress damages are based on the harm you suffered, not on whether the content still exists. Even after removal, you may continue to experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health effects. The period during which the post was live, the number of people who saw it, and the ongoing psychological impact all factor into your claim. Removal can actually support your case by showing you took active steps to mitigate harm."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is emotional distress from an AWDTSG post different from defamation damages?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Defamation and emotional distress are separate legal claims with different elements and potentially different damages. Defamation focuses on reputational harm from false statements, while emotional distress focuses on psychological and emotional harm. You can pursue both claims simultaneously. In some cases, emotional distress damages exceed defamation damages because the psychological impact is more severe than the reputational impact."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my emotional distress is from a true AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Truth is generally a defense to defamation claims but may not defeat an emotional distress claim. If someone posted true but private information in an AWDTSG group — such as medical conditions, financial details, or intimate photographs — you may have claims for invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private facts, or intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the manner and context of the disclosure, separate from any defamation analysis."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do I have to file an emotional distress lawsuit for an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Statutes of limitations for emotional distress claims vary by state, typically ranging from one to three years. Some states measure from the date of the conduct causing distress, while others use a discovery rule measuring from when you first learned about the post. Because men are blocked from AWDTSG groups and may not discover posts immediately, the discovery rule is particularly relevant. Consult an attorney promptly to protect your rights."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I get the AWDTSG post removed before or after filing an emotional distress claim?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ideally, pursue removal and legal claims simultaneously. Removing the post stops ongoing harm and demonstrates you are taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages. However, make sure you preserve all evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps) before removal occurs. Professional removal services like Tea App Green Flags document everything as part of the removal process, ensuring your legal evidence is preserved even as the harmful content is eliminated."}}]}

        <p>Finding a defamatory post about yourself in an AWDTSG group doesn't just damage your reputation. It damages you. The anxiety that follows you through the day. The sleepless nights wondering who has read it. The paranoia that every new person you meet has already seen the post. The feeling that your name — your identity — has been hijacked by someone else's lies.</p>

<p>These feelings are not just valid. They may be legally compensable.</p>

<p>Beyond defamation claims focused on reputational harm, the law recognizes separate causes of action for the emotional and psychological damage caused by someone else's extreme conduct. If an AWDTSG post has caused you genuine emotional distress — anxiety, depression, insomnia, social withdrawal, panic attacks — you may have the right to sue for mental health damages independent of any defamation claim.</p>

<p>This guide covers the legal framework for emotional distress claims, how to document your damages, available mental health resources, and how post removal fits into your recovery.</p>

<h2>Understanding Emotional Distress as a Legal Claim</h2>

<p>Emotional distress claims are distinct from defamation claims. While <a href="/blog/awdtsg-defamation-legal-rights">defamation focuses on reputational harm from false statements</a>, emotional distress claims focus on the psychological impact of someone's conduct on your mental health. This distinction matters because emotional distress claims:</p>

<li><strong>May apply even when statements are true.</strong> Unlike defamation, which requires falsity, emotional distress claims focus on the conduct itself. Posting true but deeply private information in front of thousands of people can constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.</li>

<li><strong>May yield larger damages.</strong> Courts have awarded substantial emotional distress damages in online harassment and defamation cases — sometimes exceeding reputational damages because the internal harm is more severe than the external harm.</li>

<li><strong>Don't require proving all elements of defamation.</strong> If the defamatory statements are opinions rather than provable facts (making a technical defamation claim difficult), you may still have an emotional distress claim based on the poster's overall conduct.</li>

<p>Two primary legal theories support emotional distress claims: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED).</p>

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up, more people see it — and the emotional toll deepens.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, exposure compounds fast. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.

<h2>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)</h2>

<p>IIED is the stronger of the two emotional distress claims and is the most commonly pursued in AWDTSG situations. To prove IIED, you generally must establish four elements:</p>

<h3>1. Extreme and Outrageous Conduct</h3>

<p>The poster's behavior must go beyond all bounds of decency. Courts use phrases like "utterly intolerable in a civilized community" and "beyond all possible bounds of decency." In the context of AWDTSG posts, conduct that courts may find extreme and outrageous includes:</p>

<li><strong>Fabricating serious criminal accusations.</strong> Falsely accusing someone of sexual assault, domestic violence, or other crimes in front of thousands of women — many of whom live in the same community — qualifies as extreme conduct in most jurisdictions.</li>

<li><strong>Posting private medical information.</strong> Sharing false or even true claims about someone's STD status, mental health conditions, or medical history to a massive audience goes beyond ordinary insensitivity.</li>

<li><strong>Coordinated harassment campaigns.</strong> Posting in multiple AWDTSG groups simultaneously, encouraging others to share and comment, or orchestrating a pile-on against one person demonstrates deliberate intent to cause maximum harm.</li>

<li><strong>Revenge-motivated posting.</strong> When the poster's clear motivation is to punish an ex-partner rather than warn other women, courts are more likely to find the conduct extreme and outrageous. See our guide on <a href="/blog/revenge-posts-awdtsg-malicious-intent">revenge posts and proving malicious intent</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Posting intimate images or private details.</strong> Including private photographs, sexual details, or other intimate information without consent in an AWDTSG post may constitute both IIED and invasion of privacy.</li>

<h3>2. Intent or Recklessness</h3>

<p>The poster must have acted intentionally to cause emotional distress or with reckless disregard for the likelihood that their conduct would cause severe emotional distress. In most AWDTSG situations, this element is readily provable:</p>

<li>A reasonable person knows that posting false criminal accusations about someone in front of thousands of strangers will cause severe emotional distress.</li>
<li>A reasonable person knows that publishing someone's (false) medical information to their dating community will cause severe emotional distress.</li>
<li>A poster who writes "I hope this ruins him" or "let's make sure everyone knows what he's really like" has explicitly stated their intent.</li>

<h3>3. Causation</h3>

<p>The poster's conduct must have actually caused your emotional distress. This means establishing a clear connection between the post and your psychological symptoms. Timing is key: if your anxiety and depression began or significantly worsened after discovering the post, causation is typically straightforward to establish.</p>

<h3>4. Severity of Distress</h3>

<p>Your emotional distress must be severe — not merely annoying or embarrassing. Courts look for distress that a reasonable person would be unable to endure. Evidence of severe distress includes:</p>

<li>Diagnosed anxiety, depression, or PTSD</li>
<li>Prescribed medication for mental health symptoms</li>
<li>Inability to work or reduced job performance</li>
<li>Social withdrawal and relationship deterioration</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances, eating disorders, or physical symptoms</li>
<li>Suicidal ideation (documented through therapy records)</li>

<h2>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)</h2>

<p>NIED applies when the poster didn't specifically intend to cause emotional distress but failed to exercise reasonable care, and that negligence foreseeably caused you harm. NIED is a fallback claim when proving intentional conduct is difficult.</p>

<strong>When NIED applies in AWDTSG cases:</strong>

<li>The poster carelessly repeated unverified rumors without checking their accuracy</li>
<li>The poster shared information from a friend without independently confirming it</li>
<li>The poster made assumptions about your behavior that turned out to be false</li>
<li>The poster didn't realize the group had hundreds of thousands of members and that the post would reach such a wide audience</li>

<p>NIED claims typically result in lower damages than IIED claims because the conduct is negligent rather than intentional. However, NIED can be easier to prove because you don't need to establish intent or extreme and outrageous conduct — only that the poster failed to act reasonably and that your distress was foreseeable.</p>

<h2>Documenting Your Emotional Distress</h2>

<p>Documentation is the foundation of any emotional distress claim. Courts require evidence — not just your testimony — that you suffered genuine, severe emotional distress. Start building your documentation immediately upon discovering the AWDTSG post.</p>

<h3>Therapy and Counseling Records</h3>

<strong>This is the single most important category of evidence.</strong> Seek therapy or counseling as soon as possible after discovering the post. Your therapist's records will document:

<li>Your diagnosis (anxiety, depression, adjustment disorder, PTSD, etc.)</li>
<li>Your reported symptoms and their severity</li>
<li>The connection between the AWDTSG post and your mental health decline</li>
<li>Your treatment plan and progress</li>
<li>Any medication prescribed by a psychiatrist</li>

<p>Courts give significant weight to mental health professional opinions. A therapist who documents that your anxiety disorder was triggered by the AWDTSG post provides powerful evidence of causation and severity.</p>

<h3>Personal Documentation</h3>

<p>Maintain a daily journal documenting how the AWDTSG post affects you:</p>

<li><strong>Sleep disturbances.</strong> Record nights of insomnia, nightmares, or disrupted sleep. Note the time you went to bed, how long it took to fall asleep, and how many times you woke up.</li>
<li><strong>Anxiety symptoms.</strong> Document panic attacks, racing thoughts, hypervigilance on dating apps, fear of being recognized by people who read the post.</li>
<li><strong>Social withdrawal.</strong> Note events you declined to attend, relationships you avoided, dating app accounts you deleted or paused.</li>
<li><strong>Professional impact.</strong> Record missed workdays, reduced productivity, difficulty concentrating, and any performance-related consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Physical symptoms.</strong> Stress-related headaches, stomach problems, appetite changes, weight loss or gain, elevated blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship deterioration.</strong> Changes in friendships, family dynamics, or romantic relationships attributable to the stress of the AWDTSG post.</li>

<h3>Third-Party Testimony</h3>

<p>Ask friends, family members, and coworkers to document changes they've observed in your behavior since the post was published. Their testimony provides independent corroboration that your distress is genuine and visible to others. Helpful observations include:</p>

<li>"He stopped coming to social events after [date]"</li>
<li>"He seemed anxious and distracted at work, which was out of character"</li>
<li>"He told me he was having trouble sleeping and was constantly checking his phone"</li>
<li>"His personality changed — he became withdrawn and irritable"</li>

<h3>Medical Records</h3>

<p>If your emotional distress has produced physical symptoms, document them through medical visits. A doctor who notes elevated blood pressure, stress-related gastrointestinal problems, or other physical manifestations of anxiety creates a medical record linking the AWDTSG post to measurable health impacts.</p>

<h2>When Courts Award Emotional Distress Damages</h2>

<p>Courts have awarded emotional distress damages in online defamation and harassment cases across the country. While every case is unique, several factors influence the size of awards:</p>

<h3>Factors That Increase Awards</h3>

<strong>Severity of the false statements.</strong> Accusations of sexual assault or violent crimes cause more severe distress than milder claims, and courts award accordingly.

<strong>Size of the audience.</strong> AWDTSG groups with hundreds of thousands of members expose victims to enormous audiences, increasing both the harm and the resulting damages.

<strong>Duration of exposure.</strong> Posts that remained visible for months or years before removal caused prolonged suffering that courts compensate with higher awards.

<strong>Evidence of malice.</strong> When the poster acted out of revenge, spite, or deliberate cruelty, courts are more willing to award substantial compensatory and punitive damages.

<strong>Impact on daily functioning.</strong> Evidence that the distress affected your ability to work, maintain relationships, or perform normal daily activities supports higher awards.

<strong>Documented treatment.</strong> Consistent therapy records showing a clear diagnosis and treatment plan provide the objective evidence courts need to justify significant awards.

<h3>Factors That Reduce Awards</h3>

<strong>Minimal documentation.</strong> Claims of severe distress without therapy records, medical documentation, or third-party testimony are difficult to prove.

<strong>Pre-existing conditions.</strong> If you had anxiety or depression before the post, the defense will argue your distress was not caused by their client's conduct. However, you can counter by showing the post significantly worsened your pre-existing condition.

<strong>Delay in seeking treatment.</strong> Waiting months after discovering the post before seeking therapy can undermine claims of severe distress.

<strong>Inconsistent behavior.</strong> If your social media shows you attending parties, going on dates, and appearing happy during the period you claim severe distress, the defense will use this to challenge your claim's credibility.

<h2>Therapy and Mental Health Resources</h2>

<p>If an AWDTSG post is affecting your mental health, seeking professional help is both personally important and legally strategic. Here are resources to consider:</p>

<h3>Finding a Therapist</h3>

<strong>Psychology Today Therapist Directory</strong> (psychologytoday.com/us/therapists): Search by location, insurance, specialty, and issue. Filter for therapists experienced with online harassment, reputation damage, or cyberbullying — a widespread problem that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a> found affects 41% of Americans.

<strong>BetterHelp</strong> (betterhelp.com): Online therapy platform offering text, phone, and video sessions. Convenient for immediate access to counseling without waiting for in-person appointments.

<strong>Your insurance provider's directory:</strong> Call the number on your insurance card to find in-network therapists. Many plans cover mental health services with minimal copays.

<h3>What to Tell Your Therapist</h3>

<p>Be specific about the AWDTSG post and its impact on your life. Explain:</p>

<li>What the post said and how widely it was distributed</li>
<li>When you discovered it and how you found out</li>
<li>How it has affected your daily functioning, relationships, and work</li>
<li>Specific symptoms: anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic attacks, social withdrawal</li>
<li>Any thoughts of self-harm (therapists are trained to address these safely)</li>

<p>Your therapist needs this context to provide effective treatment and to create records that accurately reflect the cause and severity of your distress.</p>

<h3>Crisis Resources</h3>

<p>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or thoughts of self-harm:</p>

<li><strong>988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:</strong> Call or text 988 (available 24/7)</li>
<li><strong>Crisis Text Line:</strong> Text HOME to 741741</li>
<li><strong>SAMHSA National Helpline:</strong> 1-800-662-4357</li>

<strong>You are not alone, and your feelings are valid.</strong> Being publicly defamed in front of thousands of people is a genuinely traumatic experience. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

<h2>How Post Removal Supports Recovery</h2>

<p>Mental health professionals consistently emphasize that ongoing exposure to the source of distress impedes recovery. As long as the AWDTSG post remains visible, you face continuous triggering:</p>

<li><strong>Anticipatory anxiety:</strong> Worrying about who is reading the post right now, whether new people in your life have seen it, whether it will appear in a Google search.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervigilance:</strong> Constantly checking whether the post is still up, whether new comments have appeared, whether it has been shared to other groups.</li>
<li><strong>Re-traumatization:</strong> Every time someone mentions the post or you encounter evidence that people have read it, you relive the original discovery.</li>

<strong>Removing the post eliminates the ongoing source of harm.</strong> While removal doesn't erase the damage already done, it stops the bleeding. Clients who achieve post removal through <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">our professional services</a> consistently report significant reduction in anxiety and improvement in daily functioning within weeks of confirmed removal.

<p>Professional removal also provides a sense of agency and control. One of the most psychologically damaging aspects of AWDTSG posts is the feeling of helplessness — that your reputation is being destroyed and there's nothing you can do. Taking action through professional removal restores your sense of control over your own narrative.</p>

<h3>The Recovery Timeline</h3>

<p>Based on our experience with 1,000+ clients:</p>

<li><strong>Weeks 1-2 after removal:</strong> Immediate relief and reduction in acute anxiety. Clients report sleeping better and feeling less hypervigilant.</li>
<li><strong>Months 1-3:</strong> Gradual return to normal social functioning. Clients begin dating again, attending social events, and re-engaging with activities they had avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> With continued therapy and ongoing monitoring to prevent reposting, most clients report substantial recovery. Residual anxiety typically manageable and decreasing.</li>
<li><strong>6+ months:</strong> Most clients report that the experience, while unpleasant, no longer dominates their daily thoughts. Ongoing <a href="/blog/awdtsg-monitoring-track-mentions-guide">reputation monitoring</a> provides reassurance that the content has not resurfaced.</li>

<h2>Building Your Case: A Step-by-Step Approach</h2>

<p>If you're considering pursuing emotional distress damages, here's the recommended sequence of actions:</p>

<strong>1. Preserve all evidence.</strong> Screenshot the post, comments, shares, the group, and the poster's profile. Use our guide on <a href="/blog/posted-in-awdtsg-what-to-do">what to do immediately when posted in AWDTSG</a> for comprehensive evidence preservation steps.

<strong>2. Begin therapy immediately.</strong> Schedule an appointment with a mental health professional. Describe the situation and your symptoms in detail. This starts the documentation clock.

<strong>3. Start a personal journal.</strong> Begin daily documentation of how the post affects your life, relationships, work, and mental health.

<strong>4. Engage professional removal.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact Tea App Green Flags</a> to begin removal. Stopping the ongoing harm is crucial for both your health and your legal case.

<strong>5. Consult a defamation/personal injury attorney.</strong> Bring your evidence, therapy records, and journal to an attorney who handles emotional distress and defamation cases. Many offer free consultations.

<strong>6. Continue treatment and documentation.</strong> Maintain consistent therapy sessions and journal entries throughout the process. Gaps in treatment can be used to argue your distress wasn't severe.

<h2>The Intersection of Removal and Legal Action</h2>

<p>A common question is whether pursuing professional removal hurts a potential emotional distress lawsuit. The answer is no — it actually helps.</p>

<strong>Removal demonstrates mitigation of damages.</strong> Courts expect plaintiffs to take reasonable steps to minimize their harm. Pursuing professional removal shows you acted responsibly to stop the ongoing damage. Failure to seek removal when it was available could actually reduce your damages award.

<strong>Removal doesn't destroy evidence.</strong> Professional removal services like Tea App Green Flags preserve comprehensive documentation of the defamatory content as part of the removal process. Your evidence remains intact even after the post is gone.

<strong>Removal focuses your damages.</strong> Once the post is removed, your damages have a clear start date and end date (for the public exposure period). This makes calculating compensable harm more straightforward for courts and juries.

<strong>Removal enables recovery.</strong> A plaintiff who has begun to recover after post removal presents a more sympathetic and credible figure than one who is still in active crisis. Your case can show the arc: harm, action, recovery — with the poster responsible for the harm and the associated costs.

<h2>You Deserve to Feel Safe Again</h2>

<p>Being defamed in an AWDTSG group is not something you should have to simply endure. The law recognizes that deliberate or reckless emotional harm is compensable. Your mental health matters — not just as a legal claim, but as a fundamental aspect of your wellbeing.</p>

<p>If an AWDTSG post is affecting your mental health, take the first step today. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact Tea App Green Flags</a> for a free consultation on removing the post, and reach out to a mental health professional to begin your recovery. You don't have to face this alone.</p>
