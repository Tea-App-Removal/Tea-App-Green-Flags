        <p>Indiana's central location and Midwestern values make reputation deeply personal. When a false post appears in an Indiana "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group, it doesn't just affect your dating life — it cuts through the social fabric of communities where people take character seriously. The Indianapolis AWDTSG group has over 10,000 members, and active groups across the state mean your exposure spans from the lakeshore to the Ohio River.</p>

<p>If someone has posted your name and photo with false accusations in an Indiana AWDTSG group, the damage is spreading through your professional and personal networks right now. <a href="https://iga.in.gov/laws/2024/ic/titles/34#34-15">Indiana's defamation laws</a> support removal, and professional services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Indiana</h2>

<p>Indiana's AWDTSG groups cover every major metro area, with Indianapolis serving as the central hub for the state's dating scene.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Indianapolis</strong> — Over 10,000 members covering the Indy metro including Carmel, Fishers, Noblesville, Greenwood, Brownsburg, and the Broad Ripple/Mass Ave social scene</li>
<li><strong>Fort Wayne</strong> — Serving northeast Indiana's second-largest metro</li>
<li><strong>Evansville</strong> — Covering the Tri-State area of southwest Indiana, including connections to Kentucky and Illinois dating scenes</li>
<li><strong>South Bend/Mishawaka</strong> — Serving the Notre Dame community and Michiana region</li>
<li><strong>Bloomington</strong> — Indiana University community with high engagement during academic terms</li>
<li><strong>Lafayette/West Lafayette</strong> — Purdue University community dating scene</li>
<li><strong>Terre Haute</strong> — Covering the Wabash Valley area including ISU</li>
<li><strong>Muncie</strong> — Serving the Ball State University community and east-central Indiana</li>

<p>Indianapolis dominates Indiana's AWDTSG activity. The city's concentrated social scene — centered around Broad Ripple, Mass Ave, Fountain Square, and the downtown entertainment district — means AWDTSG posts frequently reference specific venues and social circles that make them instantly identifiable to people in those communities.</p>

<p>Indiana's large college population across IU, Purdue, Notre Dame, Ball State, and other universities creates seasonal spikes in AWDTSG activity that coincide with academic terms and campus social events.</p>

<h2>Indiana Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Indiana provides clear legal protections against defamation with well-established statutory and case law frameworks.</p>

<strong>Indiana Code § 34-15-1-1 through § 34-15-1-4</strong> governs defamation in the state. Indiana recognizes both libel and slander, with social media posts in AWDTSG groups constituting libel.

<p>Indiana recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Tend to injure someone in their trade, business, or profession</li>
<li>Impute unchastity or sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, damages are presumed without requiring proof of specific financial harm. Most AWDTSG posts qualify because they typically contain false accusations of cheating, abuse, or criminal behavior.</p>

<p>The statute of limitations for defamation in Indiana is <strong>two years</strong> under <strong>Indiana Code § 34-11-2-4</strong>.</p>

<strong>Indiana Code § 35-45-2-2</strong> addresses harassment, including electronic harassment through social media. Indiana's harassment statute is broad enough to encompass targeted AWDTSG posting campaigns and coordinated online attacks.

<strong>Indiana Code § 35-45-10</strong> covers cyberstalking and the use of electronic communication to harass, intimidate, or threaten. Repeated AWDTSG posting or coordinated campaigns against an individual may constitute cyberstalking under Indiana law.

<p>Indiana courts have recognized <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> claims including false light and public disclosure of private facts. When AWDTSG posts reveal private dating history, personal information, or intimate details, these privacy torts provide additional legal leverage for removal.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Indiana</h2>

<p>Our Indiana removal process addresses the state's community-centered dynamics and leverages Indiana's defamation and privacy protections.</p>

<strong>Statewide Coverage.</strong> We identify defamatory content across all Indiana AWDTSG groups, from Indianapolis to Fort Wayne to the university communities. Cross-posting between Indiana groups is common.

<strong>Indiana Legal Documentation.</strong> Our demands cite IC § 34-15-1-1 and applicable per se categories, along with harassment and cyberstalking statutes where appropriate. Indiana's two-year statute of limitations provides a solid legal window.

<strong>Midwest Crossover Monitoring.</strong> Indiana's central location means AWDTSG posts spread to groups in Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, and Michigan. We track and address this cross-state migration.

<strong>University Community Awareness.</strong> For targets in Indiana's large college communities, we understand the unique social dynamics and address campus-specific spreading channels.

<strong>Complete Platform Cleanup.</strong> We handle Facebook group removal, screenshot tracking across Instagram and Reddit, Google deindexing, and ongoing monitoring for reposting. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.

<h2>Indiana Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under IC § 34-11-2-4, Indiana provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Indiana recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Indiana courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in IN county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published.
