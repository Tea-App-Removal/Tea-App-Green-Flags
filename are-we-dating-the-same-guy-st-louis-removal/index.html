        <p>You're winding down after a long day working downtown near the Gateway Arch when a text from your college buddy hits: "Bro, you need to see this." It's a screenshot from the St. Louis "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group. Your photo, your first name, and a detailed accusation that you're emotionally abusive and have been "playing multiple women." The post has been up for eight hours. Over two hundred women have already engaged with it. St. Louis AWDTSG removal is now the only thing that matters.</p>

<p>St. Louis has a famously close social culture — the city where the first question people ask is "Where did you go to high school?" That tight interconnectedness means an AWDTSG post doesn't just float in a digital vacuum. It reaches people in your extended network across the Central West End, Soulard, the Grove, and every neighborhood in between.</p>

<h2>The St. Louis AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The St. Louis "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group has over eleven thousand members and is one of the most active groups in the Midwest. This group has 11,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly. Find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/3152230525105772/">facebook.com/groups/3152230525105772/</a>. Posts are governed by <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The group covers the entire St. Louis metropolitan area on both sides of the river — from Clayton, University City, and Kirkwood on the Missouri side to Belleville, O'Fallon, and Edwardsville on the Illinois side. St. Louis's unique geography, spanning two states, means the AWDTSG group draws from a broad but socially interconnected population.</p>

<p>St. Louis's "where did you go to high school" culture means social networks run deep and overlapping. A post in the St. Louis AWDTSG group doesn't just reach strangers on dating apps. It reaches women who went to your high school, who work in your building, who go to your gym in Brentwood, or who attend the same events in the Delmar Loop. The social proximity amplifies the damage exponentially.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the St. Louis AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 14,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in St. Louis</h2>

<p>St. Louis's dating scene is active on Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder, but the city also has a strong culture of meeting people through social events, mutual friends, and neighborhood bars. The Central West End, Soulard, the Grove, and Cherokee Street all serve as social hubs where dating life and social life merge. A false AWDTSG post can travel from a Facebook group to a barstool conversation at Schlafly or Urban Chestnut in a single afternoon.</p>

<p>The spread pattern in St. Louis is particularly problematic because of the metro's dual-state nature. Content posted in the St. Louis AWDTSG group often gets shared to Kansas City's group, broader Missouri dating communities, and Southern Illinois networks. Screenshots migrate to Instagram Stories, group texts, <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App</a>, and Reddit's StLouis subreddit.</p>

<p>For St. Louis professionals, the cross-platform spread is especially dangerous. Search engines index mentions across multiple platforms, meaning anyone Googling your name — a hiring manager at Anheuser-Busch, a client at a downtown law firm, a colleague at BJC HealthCare — could encounter defamatory content from a source they've never heard of.</p>

<h2>Missouri Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Missouri provides meaningful legal protections against defamation. <a href="https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=509.210">Under Missouri law (RSMo § 509.050 and related case law)</a>, defamation occurs when someone publishes a false statement of fact to a third party that damages your reputation. Missouri recognizes both libel (written defamation, including social media posts) and slander.</p>

<p>Missouri also recognizes defamation per se — false statements imputing criminal conduct, professional incompetence, or a "loathsome disease" are presumed to cause damages. Many AWDTSG posts in St. Louis contain accusations that qualify as per se defamation, giving victims strong legal leverage without needing to prove specific dollar amounts in damages.</p>

<p>Missouri's legal framework creates powerful tools for <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional Facebook defamation removal services</a>. Properly documented legal demands citing Missouri statutes get routed through Facebook's legal review channels, achieving results that standard reporting never approaches.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for St. Louis AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>If you've been falsely posted in St. Louis's "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group, you've probably already discovered that Facebook's report button does essentially nothing. The group admins view themselves as protecting women's safety. Facebook's automated review process doesn't flag these posts. Meanwhile, every hour the post stays up, more women in St. Louis see it.</p>

<p>Professional removal services approach St. Louis AWDTSG cases through legal channels that bypass the standard moderation system:</p>

<li><strong>Full-scope documentation</strong> — We identify the original post, catalog all comments and shares, and track spread to other Missouri groups, Illinois groups, and other platforms</li>
<li><strong>Missouri-specific legal drafting</strong> — Our team prepares removal demands citing Missouri defamation statutes and documenting specific false claims</li>
<li><strong>Legal channel submission</strong> — Documentation enters Facebook's legal review process rather than the community standards reporting queue</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform and cross-state cleanup</strong> — Given St. Louis's dual-state geography, we address spread into both Missouri and Illinois networks</li>
<li><strong>Post-removal monitoring</strong> — St. Louis's tight social circles mean content can resurface. We monitor for reposting attempts</li>

<p>Most St. Louis AWDTSG removals complete within 30 to 90 days with success rates between ninety-two and ninety-five percent. The dual-state coverage ensures no content slips through because it jumped from a Missouri group to an Illinois one.</p>

<h2>St. Louis Professional Community Impact</h2>

<p>St. Louis is home to major corporate headquarters, a massive healthcare system, and thriving financial and legal sectors. Companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev, Edward Jones, Emerson Electric, and Centene call St. Louis home, along with world-class medical institutions like Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University Medical Center.</p>

<p>For St. Louis professionals, a defamatory AWDTSG post is a career threat. Background screening, client vetting, and professional networking all involve online reputation. A false accusation of abusive or predatory behavior — even in a Facebook dating group — can surface during the most critical professional moments.</p>

<p>Our St. Louis AWDTSG removal service addresses the complete picture: removing the Facebook post, cleaning up cross-platform spread, deindexing search engine results, and monitoring for recurrence. Your career and your personal life both deserve protection.</p>



<h2>St. Louis Area Service Coverage</h2>

<p>Our St. Louis AWDTSG removal services cover the entire St. Louis metropolitan area (population 2.8M metro) including surrounding communities. The St. Louis area code (314) and ZIP codes starting with 63101 define the core service area.
