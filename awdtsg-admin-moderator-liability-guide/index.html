    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue an AWDTSG group admin for defamation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, in certain circumstances. If an AWDTSG admin actively participates in creating, editing, or amplifying defamatory content — rather than passively hosting it — they may be held personally liable. The 2025 Belliveau v Quinlan ruling in Canada established that admins who approve defamatory posts bear personal responsibility. In the US, liability depends on the admin's level of involvement and applicable state law."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Section 230 protect AWDTSG group admins from lawsuits?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Section 230 protects platforms and passive intermediaries, but its application to active group admins is increasingly contested. Courts have found that admins who curate, approve, edit, or add commentary to posts may lose Section 230 protection because they are functioning as content creators rather than neutral hosts. The law is evolving rapidly in this area."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What did the Belliveau v Quinlan case decide about admin liability?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In the 2025 Canadian ruling Belliveau v Quinlan, the court found that an &quot;Are We Dating the Same Guy&quot; group admin was personally liable for defamatory posts she approved and allowed to remain in the group. The admin was ordered to pay damages. While this is a Canadian decision, it signals a growing international trend toward holding group administrators accountable."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between US and Canadian law on admin liability?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The US has Section 230, which provides broader immunity for intermediaries than any comparable Canadian law. Canada does not have a Section 230 equivalent, making it easier to hold admins liable there. However, US courts are increasingly recognizing that active curation and approval of content by admins goes beyond passive hosting, potentially removing Section 230 protection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue an AWDTSG admin if they refuse to remove a defamatory post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Refusal to remove content alone may not create liability under current US law, but it strengthens your case significantly. When an admin is formally notified that a post contains provably false statements and chooses to leave it up, this demonstrates knowledge and potential ratification of the defamatory content. Combined with other factors like active curation, this can support a liability claim."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I identify who the AWDTSG group admin is?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Facebook group admin identities can sometimes be found through the group's About section or member list filters. If the admin uses a pseudonym or privacy settings prevent identification, your attorney can subpoena Meta for admin account information as part of a defamation lawsuit. Professional removal services also have methods for identifying group administrators."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I contact the AWDTSG admin directly to request removal?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Direct contact is generally not recommended. Admins who run AWDTSG groups are typically hostile toward men who request removal, and your message may be screenshotted and shared in the group to generate further ridicule. Professional removal services handle admin communication through established channels that maximize removal success without exposing you to additional risk."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What damages can I recover if I sue an AWDTSG admin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you successfully prove admin liability, you may recover compensatory damages for reputational harm, lost income, emotional distress, and other documented losses. If you're struggling, resources like the [988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support. If you're struggling, resources like the [988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support. If the admin acted with actual malice — knowingly allowing false content to remain — punitive damages may also be available. The Belliveau v Quinlan case awarded substantial damages against the admin."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it better to sue the poster or the admin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In most cases, the original poster bears primary liability and is the stronger legal target. However, suing the admin may be strategic if the poster is anonymous and the admin is identifiable, if the admin added their own defamatory commentary, or if the admin actively curated and promoted the content. Your attorney can advise on the best targets for your specific situation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is professional removal faster than suing an AWDTSG admin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Significantly faster. Lawsuits against admins take months to years and cost $15,000 to $150,000 or more. Professional removal services typically achieve post removal within 30 to 90 days at a fraction of the cost. Many clients pursue professional removal for speed while consulting attorneys about potential legal claims for damages."}}]}

        <p>When you discover a defamatory post about you in an "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group, your first instinct might be to report it to the group admin. After all, admins control what stays up and what comes down. But AWDTSG admins rarely help men who are the subjects of posts — and increasingly, these admins are finding themselves on the wrong side of the law.</p>

<p>The question of whether AWDTSG group admins and moderators can be held legally liable for defamatory posts is one of the most important and rapidly evolving areas of internet defamation law. A landmark 2025 Canadian ruling sent shockwaves through AWDTSG communities, and US courts are developing their own framework for admin accountability.</p>

<p>If you've been defamed in an AWDTSG group and the admin won't lift a finger, understanding their legal exposure — and your options — is critical.</p>

<h2>The Role of AWDTSG Admins and Moderators</h2>

<p>To understand admin liability, you first need to understand what AWDTSG admins actually do. These are not passive bystanders. Most "Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups operate with a structured moderation system:</p>

<strong>Content approval.</strong> Most AWDTSG groups require admin or moderator approval before posts go live. This means someone in a position of authority reviews the content — including photos, names, and accusations — and actively decides to publish it to thousands of members.

<strong>Rule enforcement.</strong> Admins set and enforce group rules about what can and cannot be posted. They make editorial decisions about which posts comply with guidelines and which don't.

<strong>Content removal decisions.</strong> When posts are reported or flagged, admins decide whether to remove them or let them stand. This gatekeeping function means they exercise ongoing control over group content.

<strong>Community curation.</strong> Many admins actively participate in discussions, pin certain posts, add their own commentary, and shape the overall narrative of the group. Some admins publicly support posters and dismiss concerns from men who've been named.

<p>This level of active involvement distinguishes AWDTSG admins from truly passive platform operators — and that distinction matters enormously in the eyes of the law.</p>

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Admins won't remove your post, but we can.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, every day the post stays up means more damage to your reputation. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.

<h2>The Belliveau v Quinlan Ruling: A Game-Changer</h2>

<p>In 2025, a Canadian court handed down a decision in <strong>Belliveau v Quinlan</strong> that sent a clear message to AWDTSG admins worldwide: you can be held personally liable for defamatory content in your group.</p>

<p>The case involved an "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group in Canada where the admin approved and allowed defamatory posts about a man to remain in the group despite being notified that the content was false. The court found the admin personally liable for the harm caused by the defamatory posts.</p>

<strong>Key findings from the ruling:</strong>

<li>The admin exercised editorial control by approving posts before they went live</li>
<li>Approving defamatory content for publication constitutes participation in the defamation</li>
<li>The admin had the power to remove the content and chose not to</li>
<li>Notification of falsity and continued publication demonstrated ratification of the defamatory statements</li>
<li>The admin was ordered to pay damages to the plaintiff</li>

<p>This ruling established a clear precedent: <strong>running an AWDTSG group is not a liability-free activity</strong>. Admins who approve defamatory content and refuse to remove it when notified of falsity bear personal responsibility for the resulting harm.</p>

<p>While Belliveau v Quinlan is a Canadian decision, it reflects a growing international consensus that social media group administrators are not merely passive conduits. US courts, which are developing their own framework, have taken notice of this reasoning.</p>

<h2>Section 230: What It Actually Protects (and What It Doesn't)</h2>

<p>In the United States, the legal landscape for admin liability centers on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This 1996 law is frequently misunderstood — both by AWDTSG admins who believe it makes them untouchable and by men who believe it makes any legal action futile.</p>

<strong>What Section 230 actually says:</strong>

<blockquote>"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."</blockquote>

<strong>What this means for AWDTSG groups:</strong>

<strong>Facebook (Meta) is clearly protected.</strong> As the platform hosting AWDTSG groups, Facebook qualifies for Section 230 immunity. This is why <a href="/blog/awdtsg-complete-guide-for-men">Facebook's own reporting tools are largely ineffective</a> — the platform has no legal obligation to remove defamatory user-generated content.

<strong>Original posters are NOT protected.</strong> The person who writes a defamatory AWDTSG post is the "information content provider" and has zero Section 230 protection. They are fully liable for defamatory statements. Learn more about <a href="/blog/can-you-sue-awdtsg-post">suing for defamation over AWDTSG posts</a>.

<strong>Group admins occupy contested legal territory.</strong> This is where it gets interesting and increasingly favorable for plaintiffs.

<h3>When Admins May Lose Section 230 Protection</h3>

<p>Courts have identified several scenarios where group admins may cross the line from protected intermediary to unprotected content creator or developer:</p>

<strong>Active content creation.</strong> When an admin adds their own commentary, edits posts, or combines information from multiple sources to create new defamatory content, they become a content creator with no Section 230 shield.

<strong>Material contribution to illegality.</strong> Under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation in <em>Fair Housing Council v. Roommates.com</em> (2008), a party that materially contributes to the illegality of content may lose Section 230 protection. An admin who solicits defamatory posts, creates templates for accusations, or encourages specific types of harmful content may fall into this category.

<strong>Editorial approval and curation.</strong> The argument that admins who actively screen and approve content before publication are functioning as editors — not passive hosts — is gaining traction. An editor who reviews content and decides to publish it is fundamentally different from a platform that automatically hosts whatever users submit.

<strong>Refusal to remove after notice.</strong> While the law on this point is still developing, several courts have considered whether knowing about defamatory content and actively choosing to keep it published demonstrates the kind of adoption or ratification that removes Section 230 protection.

<h2>US vs. Canadian Law: Key Differences</h2>

<p>Understanding the different legal frameworks is essential if your AWDTSG group operates across borders or if you're evaluating legal options:</p>

<h3>Canadian Law (More Favorable to Plaintiffs)</h3>

<p>Canada does not have a Section 230 equivalent. Canadian defamation law is also generally more plaintiff-friendly:</p>

<li><strong>No Section 230 immunity.</strong> There is no broad statutory shield for intermediaries. Admins are evaluated under traditional defamation principles.</li>
<li><strong>Lower burden on plaintiffs.</strong> In Canada, defamation is presumed once publication of a defamatory statement is proven. The defendant bears the burden of establishing a defense.</li>
<li><strong>Belliveau v Quinlan precedent.</strong> Courts have directly addressed AWDTSG admin liability and found admins personally responsible.</li>
<li><strong>Responsible communication defense is limited.</strong> While Canada's "responsible communication on matters of public interest" defense exists, courts have not readily extended it to AWDTSG groups.</li>

<h3>US Law (Evolving Rapidly)</h3>

<p>The US framework is more complex due to Section 230, but the trend is increasingly unfavorable for admins:</p>

<li><strong>Section 230 provides baseline protection</strong> for passive hosting, but active curation may remove that shield.</li>
<li><strong>State law variations</strong> create a patchwork where admin liability is more viable in some states than others.</li>
<li><strong>First Amendment considerations</strong> add another layer, though false statements of fact receive no First Amendment protection.</li>
<li><strong>The D'Ambrosio case</strong> in Illinois demonstrated that state-specific statutes like the Illinois Anti-Doxing Act can create additional liability pathways that bypass traditional Section 230 defenses.

<h2>When AWDTSG Admins Can Be Held Responsible</h2>

<p>Based on current legal trends in both the US and Canada, the following scenarios create the strongest basis for admin liability:</p>

<h3>1. Admin Creates or Edits Defamatory Content</h3>

<p>If the admin writes their own defamatory post about you, adds defamatory commentary to someone else's post, or edits a submission to make it more damaging, they are a content creator with full liability. No Section 230 protection applies.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong> An admin sees a relatively mild post about you and adds: "Oh I know this guy — he's been reported in three other groups for [false accusation]." The admin has now created original defamatory content.

<h3>2. Admin Approves Content with Knowledge of Falsity</h3>

<p>When an admin reviews a submitted post, recognizes it contains false claims (or doesn't care whether it's true), and approves it for publication, they are making an affirmative editorial decision to publish defamatory content.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong> A poster submits a claim that you have a criminal record. The admin approves the post without any verification. If the claim is false, the admin's approval constitutes active participation in publishing the defamation.

<h3>3. Admin Refuses Removal After Formal Notice</h3>

<p>If you or your attorney formally notify the admin that a post contains provably false statements and the admin refuses to remove it, this demonstrates knowledge and ratification. While not always sufficient alone under US law, it significantly strengthens liability arguments.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong> Your attorney sends a cease and desist letter identifying specific false statements in a post, providing evidence of falsity, and demanding removal. The admin ignores the letter or responds defiantly. This behavior is admissible in court as evidence of malice.

<h3>4. Admin Solicits or Encourages Defamatory Posts</h3>

<p>Some AWDTSG admins actively encourage members to post about specific individuals, create "do you know this person" threads, or establish group norms that reward the most shocking and damaging accusations.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong> An admin posts "Ladies, any tea on [your name/photo]? Drop everything you know below." This active solicitation of potentially defamatory content makes the admin a participant in creating it.

<h3>5. Admin Shares Content Beyond the Group</h3>

<p>When an admin takes a defamatory post from the AWDTSG group and shares it to other groups, social media platforms, or public forums, they become a republisher. Republication creates fresh liability with a new statute of limitations in most jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Your Removal Request</h2>

<p>Understanding admin liability doesn't just matter for potential lawsuits — it directly impacts your removal strategy.</p>

<strong>Why direct admin contact usually fails.</strong> Most AWDTSG admins view themselves as performing a public service and are ideologically opposed to removing posts about men. Direct outreach from the subject of a post is almost always ignored or used as ammunition for further mockery. Read about <a href="/blog/posted-in-awdtsg-what-to-do">what to do when you're posted in AWDTSG</a>.

<strong>Why legal pressure works.</strong> When admins understand their personal legal exposure, their calculus changes dramatically. A formal legal notice explaining specific liability theories — backed by case law like Belliveau v Quinlan — creates consequences that ideology alone cannot overcome.

<strong>Why professional removal is the most effective approach.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> understand exactly how to leverage admin liability concerns, Facebook's community standards, and multiple removal pathways simultaneously. Our team has achieved a 92-95% removal success rate because we know which pressure points work.

<strong>The timeline advantage.</strong> Professional removal typically achieves results in 30 to 90 days. Lawsuits against admins take months to years. For most men dealing with active reputational damage, professional removal addresses the immediate crisis while legal options remain available for pursuing damages.

<h2>Building Your Case Against an Admin</h2>

<p>If you're considering legal action against an AWDTSG admin, proper evidence preservation is essential from day one:</p>

<strong>Document the admin's role.</strong> Screenshot the group's admin list, the admin's profile, and any evidence of their active involvement in curating content. If the admin made comments on your post or others', preserve those.

<strong>Preserve approval evidence.</strong> If you can determine that posts require admin approval before publication (often stated in group rules), document this. It demonstrates the admin's active editorial role.

<strong>Record refusal to remove.</strong> If you or your attorney sends a removal request and the admin responds (or conspicuously ignores it), preserve all communications. This goes directly to the question of knowledge and ratification.

<strong>Track the damage timeline.</strong> Document how long the post remained up after the admin was notified. Extended publication after notice strengthens arguments about willful participation in defamation.

<strong>Identify the admin.</strong> Work with an attorney or professional service to confirm the admin's real identity. Facebook subpoenas can compel Meta to provide admin account information.

<h2>The Future of Admin Liability</h2>

<p>The legal landscape for AWDTSG admin liability is shifting rapidly and decisively in favor of accountability:</p>

<strong>Legislative momentum.</strong> Multiple states are considering legislation that would clarify group admin responsibilities for defamatory content. The growing awareness of AWDTSG harm is driving legislative interest.

<strong>Judicial trends.</strong> Courts are increasingly skeptical of broad Section 230 immunity claims when applied to active content curators rather than passive platforms. The distinction between hosting and editing is becoming sharper.

<strong>International pressure.</strong> Rulings like Belliveau v Quinlan create persuasive authority that US courts reference when developing their own frameworks. Canada, the EU, and the UK are all moving toward greater intermediary accountability.

<strong>Public awareness.</strong> As media coverage of AWDTSG harm increases, public sympathy for blanket admin immunity decreases. Juries in defamation cases are likely to be increasingly receptive to arguments that admins who actively approve and maintain defamatory content share responsibility.

<h2>Protecting Yourself Now</h2>

<p>Don't wait for the law to fully catch up with AWDTSG admin behavior. Take action today:</p>

<li><strong>Preserve all evidence.</strong> Screenshot the post, the admin's profile, group rules showing approval requirements, and any admin comments or actions related to your post.</li>

<li><strong>Do not contact the admin directly.</strong> This almost always backfires. Let professionals handle admin communication through channels that maximize success.</li>

<li><strong>Consult with professionals.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Tea App Green Flags</a> can begin the removal process immediately while you evaluate your legal options with a defamation attorney.</li>

<li><strong>Consider your legal options.</strong> If you want to pursue damages, consult with a defamation attorney who understands the evolving landscape of admin liability. The evidence you preserve now is critical for any future legal action.</li>

<li><strong>Act quickly.</strong> Every day the post remains up increases the total damage and the number of people who see it. Quick action through professional removal is the most effective way to stop the bleeding while legal strategies develop.</li>

<p>AWDTSG admins are not above the law. They never were — and courts around the world are making that increasingly clear.</p>
