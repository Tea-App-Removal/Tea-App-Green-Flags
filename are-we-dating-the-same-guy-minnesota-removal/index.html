        <p>The Twin Cities' AWDTSG group has over 18,000 members, making it one of the largest in the Upper Midwest. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. In a metro area where the professional and social scenes overlap extensively — from the corporate headquarters lining the 494 strip to the Uptown bars and North Loop restaurants that anchor the dating scene — a false AWDTSG post reaches an audience that includes colleagues, clients, and neighbors alongside potential dates.</p>

<p>If you've been falsely posted in a Minnesota AWDTSG group, the "Minnesota Nice" culture that defines life here doesn't extend to these groups. Professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates, and Minnesota law provides solid protections.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Minnesota</h2>

<p>Minnesota's AWDTSG activity centers on the Twin Cities but extends to communities throughout the state.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Minneapolis/St. Paul</strong> — Over 18,000 members covering the entire Twin Cities metro including Bloomington, Eden Prairie, Edina, Plymouth, Maple Grove, Woodbury, and St. Paul</li>
<li><strong>Rochester</strong> — Serving the Mayo Clinic community and southeastern Minnesota</li>
<li><strong>Duluth</strong> — Covering the Northland and the UMD community</li>
<li><strong>St. Cloud</strong> — Serving central Minnesota and St. Cloud State University</li>
<li><strong>Mankato</strong> — Covering southern Minnesota and the Minnesota State community</li>
<li><strong>Fargo-Moorhead</strong> — Cross-border group covering both the Minnesota and North Dakota sides</li>

<p>The Twin Cities group dominates Minnesota's AWDTSG landscape. The metro's dating scene revolves around Uptown, North Loop, Northeast Minneapolis, and the Grand Avenue/Cathedral Hill areas of St. Paul. Posts referencing specific bars, restaurants, and dating app scenes in these neighborhoods are common and immediately recognizable.</p>

<p>Minnesota's major corporate presence — Target, UnitedHealth, 3M, General Mills, Best Buy, and many more — means a significant portion of AWDTSG targets work for recognizable companies where professional reputation is critical. The corporate culture of the Twin Cities amplifies the career damage from false AWDTSG accusations.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Minnesota Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Minnesota has 7 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 5.7M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Minnesota Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Minnesota provides strong defamation protections with a well-developed legal framework. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/548.06">Minnesota Statutes § 541.07(1)</strong> sets the statute of limi</a>tations for defamation at <strong>two years</strong> from publication. Minnesota follows common law defamation principles recognizing both libel and slander.

<p>Minnesota recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their business, trade, or profession</li>
<li>Impute unchastity or serious sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, general damages are presumed. Most AWDTSG posts qualify because they typically contain false accusations of cheating, abuse, or criminal behavior. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.</p>

<strong>Minnesota Statutes § 609.749</strong> addresses stalking and harassment, including electronic communications. This comprehensive statute covers a range of harassing behaviors through social media platforms, including targeted AWDTSG campaigns.

<strong>Minnesota Statutes § 604A.01</strong> provides the Minnesota <strong>Data Practices and Privacy framework</strong>, which includes protections for personal information. While primarily focused on government data, the principles inform Minnesota courts' approach to privacy claims.

<p>Minnesota courts recognize <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> claims, including false light and public disclosure of private facts. These causes of action provide additional legal tools for AWDTSG removal when posts share private information or create misleading portrayals.</p>

<strong>Minnesota Statutes § 617.261</strong> covers nonconsensual dissemination of intimate images, applicable if such content appears in AWDTSG posts.

<h2>Minnesota Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Minn. Stat. § 541.051, Minnesota provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Minnesota recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Minnesota courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in MN county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Minn. Stat. § 541.051 and applicable Minnesota case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
