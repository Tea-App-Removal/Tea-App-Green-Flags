    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I remove my name from Are We Dating the Same Guy groups?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard Facebook reporting succeeds in roughly 2% of AWDTSG defamation cases. Professional removal through Tea App Green Flags uses legal documentation submitted through Meta's legal compliance channels, bypassing group admins who typically refuse removal requests. Success rates are 92-95% with average completion times of 10-18 business days."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I report an AWDTSG post to Facebook and get it removed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Facebook's standard reporting system almost never works for AWDTSG posts. Out of 83 tracked cases where clients tried self-reporting first, only 2 resulted in removal, and both involved copyrighted professional headshots. Facebook's content moderation AI does not flag personal dating stories as policy violations, even when they contain false claims."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I NOT do if I find a post about me in AWDTSG?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Do not create a fake account to join the group, as admins will identify and expose you. Do not confront the poster, since screenshots of your messages will be shared as new content. Do not have your partner post a defense, and do not threaten legal action publicly in the group. All of these actions amplify the damage and make professional removal harder."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to remove an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Professional removal services like Tea App Green Flags cost a fraction of what a defamation lawsuit would run ($15,000-$100,000). Professional removal delivers results in 10-18 business days compared to 12-24 months for litigation, with higher success rates. The exact cost depends on how many groups and platforms are affected."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do AWDTSG posts spread to other platforms?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Content from AWDTSG groups routinely spreads to Tea App, Instagram stories, Reddit threads, and third-party aggregator sites. Google also indexes content from secondary sources. Tea App Green Flags addresses all affected platforms in coordinated removal campaigns to ensure comprehensive cleanup."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use a [DMCA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) takedown for an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If the post includes photos you took yourself, such as selfies, you can file a DMCA takedown to remove the copyrighted image. Facebook typically processes valid DMCA requests within 7-14 business days. However, DMCA only removes the photo, not the defamatory text. For complete removal, DMCA should be combined with defamation-based removal through legal channels."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do AWDTSG posts stay visible?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"AWDTSG posts do not expire or fade. They remain in the group permanently unless removed by an admin or through platform legal processes. Posts with high engagement get screenshotted, shared across group chats, and indexed by Google, creating a permanent digital record. The longer a post remains, the more damage it causes and the harder removal becomes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will an AWDTSG post show up when someone Googles my name?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Although AWDTSG groups are private, their content frequently leaks through screenshots shared on public platforms and third-party aggregator sites that scrape group content. Google indexes these secondary sources, meaning a background check vendor or curious date can find the accusations through a simple name search."}}]}

        <p>Marcus got the text from a coworker on a Tuesday afternoon. "Hey man, I don't know how to tell you this, but there's a post about you in this Facebook group my girlfriend is in." Attached was a screenshot from the "Are We Dating the Same Guy - Chicago" group. His full name. His photo pulled from LinkedIn. A detailed story claiming he had manipulated multiple women, ghosted someone after three months of dating, and had "narcissistic tendencies." The post had 247 comments and had been up for nine hours.</p>

<p>None of it was accurate. Marcus had ended a three-month relationship respectfully, in person, and the woman he'd dated had taken it badly. But by the time he saw the post, the damage had compounded. Screenshots had already been shared to two other Chicago-area AWDTSG groups. A woman he'd been talking to on Hinge stopped responding. His LinkedIn profile views had spiked, which meant people were connecting his professional identity to these accusations.</p>

<p>This is the nightmare scenario that plays out dozens of times every single day across hundreds of "Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups nationwide. And the worst part? Most men who find themselves in this situation make critical mistakes in the first 48 hours that make removal exponentially harder.</p>

<h2>How Are We Dating the Same Guy Groups Actually Work</h2>

<p>Understanding why removal is so difficult starts with understanding the group structure. AWDTSG groups operate in nearly every mid-sized to major city in the United States, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Major metro areas often have multiple groups. New York City alone has at least six active AWDTSG groups with memberships ranging from 30,000 to over 180,000 women.</p>

<p>The groups are private, meaning non-members cannot see posts. Membership is restricted to women, and most groups require answering screening questions to join. Admins verify that new members appear to be real women based on their Facebook profiles. Men are systematically excluded, which means you typically cannot see what's been posted about you without someone sharing it with you.</p>

<p>Posting requires zero evidence. A member uploads your photo (usually pulled from a dating app profile, social media, or LinkedIn), writes whatever she wants, and hits post. There is no verification process. No fact-checking. No requirement to prove anything. The group culture operates on an implicit "believe women" ethos that, while well-intentioned for legitimate safety warnings, creates zero accountability for false or exaggerated claims.</p>

<p>Comments amplify the damage. Once a post goes up, other members chime in. Some share genuine experiences. Others pile on with speculation, assumptions, or unrelated gossip. A post that starts as one person's complaint can snowball into dozens of women claiming to "know someone" who dated you, adding layers of accusation that never happened. Within hours, a single post creates a narrative that looks damning through sheer volume of engagement.</p>

<h2>Why Self-Reporting to Facebook Doesn't Work</h2>

<p>If your first instinct is to report the post through Facebook's standard reporting system, you're going to be disappointed. Here's what actually happens when you try the official channels.</p>

<strong>You probably can't even see the post.</strong> Since AWDTSG groups are private and women-only, you likely don't have direct access. You might have a screenshot, but Facebook's reporting system is designed for reporting content you can directly link to within the platform. Reporting a post you can't access presents an immediate logistical problem.

<strong>Facebook's automated review misses the point.</strong> Even if someone files the report on your behalf from inside the group, Facebook's content moderation AI scans for specific policy violations: nudity, explicit violence, hate speech, spam. A post saying "this guy is a narcissistic cheater who manipulated me for six months" doesn't trigger any of those filters. The AI categorizes it as a personal opinion or experience sharing and moves on.

<strong>Human review is a dead end too.</strong> The small percentage of reports that reach a human reviewer face a similar problem. Facebook's community standards don't prohibit someone from sharing their "experience" with another person. The reviewer sees a woman sharing a dating story in a group designed for that purpose and concludes it doesn't violate guidelines. Case closed.

<strong>Group admins actively resist removal.</strong> Most AWDTSG group admins consider themselves advocates for women's safety. When they receive requests to remove posts, whether from the subject of the post, their friends, or even their lawyers, admins typically refuse. Many groups have pinned posts explicitly stating they will not remove content based on requests from the men being discussed. Some admins go further, posting about the removal attempt itself, which generates a new wave of negative engagement.

<p>I've tracked outcomes for clients who attempted self-reporting before seeking professional help. Out of 83 cases where clients tried Facebook's reporting system first, exactly two resulted in removal. Both of those involved photos that were clearly copyrighted professional headshots, not the defamatory text itself.</p>

<h2>The DMCA Strategy That Sometimes Works (and Its Limits)</h2>

<p>One approach that does have some teeth is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown for photos. If the post includes a photo you took yourself (a selfie, for example) or a professional photo you own the rights to, you have a legitimate DMCA claim against the unauthorized use of your copyrighted image.</p>

<p>Here's the process: You file a DMCA takedown request directly with Facebook (Meta), identifying the specific copyrighted image, proving your ownership, and requesting its removal. Facebook is legally obligated to respond to valid DMCA requests, and they generally comply within seven to fourteen business days.</p>

<p>The limitation is significant, though. A successful DMCA takedown removes the <em>photo</em> but not necessarily the <em>text</em> of the post. The admin or original poster can simply re-upload the post without your photo, or use a different photo of you that someone else took (which you don't own the copyright to). Dating app screenshots, photos taken by friends, and images pulled from social media may not qualify for DMCA protection depending on who originally captured them.</p>

<p>DMCA is one tool in the toolkit, not a complete solution. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> use DMCA as part of a multi-layered approach but never rely on it alone.</p>

<h2>What Professional Removal Services Actually Do Differently</h2>

<p>Professional removal works at a fundamentally different level than DIY attempts. Here's the actual process, stripped of marketing language.</p>

<strong>Legal documentation that bypasses standard reporting.</strong> Professional services draft formal legal notices that cite specific state defamation statutes, document the falsity of claims with evidence, and outline potential platform liability under specific legal theories. These notices are submitted through Facebook's legal channels, not the standard content reporting form. Facebook's legal team operates under different guidelines than their content moderation team. When a properly documented legal notice lands on a legal reviewer's desk, the calculus changes entirely.

<strong>Direct platform relationships.</strong> Established removal services have working relationships with trust and safety teams at major platforms. They know which escalation paths produce results, which documentation formats get prioritized, and how to frame requests in language that platform legal teams respond to. This isn't about knowing a secret password. It's about understanding bureaucratic systems well enough to navigate them efficiently.

<strong>Multi-vector pressure.</strong> A single Facebook report is easy to ignore. A coordinated approach that simultaneously addresses the original post, screenshots shared to other groups, cross-platform spreading to Instagram and Reddit, and search engine indexing creates comprehensive pressure that produces results. Professional services address all vectors simultaneously rather than playing whack-a-mole with individual posts.

<strong>Post-removal monitoring.</strong> Removing the original post doesn't prevent reposting. Scorned exes who posted once will often post again when they discover the removal. <a href="/reputation-monitoring">Ongoing reputation monitoring</a> catches reposts within hours, before they gain traction, and triggers immediate follow-up removal action.

<p>The numbers bear this out. Professional removal services achieve 92-95% success rates for AWDTSG group posts, with average completion times of 10-18 business days. Compare that to the roughly 2% success rate of DIY reporting through Facebook's standard channels.</p>

<h2>Case Study: Marcus's Removal Timeline</h2>

<p>Let's go back to Marcus from the opening. After the initial shock wore off, here's what actually happened.</p>

<strong>Day 1:</strong> Marcus discovered the post. His instinct was to create a fake Facebook account to join the group and defend himself. Fortunately, a friend who works in PR talked him out of it. Instead, he documented everything: screenshots of the original post, all comments, any shares he could identify, and search engine results for his name.

<strong>Day 3:</strong> Marcus contacted our team. During the initial consultation, we identified the original post in the Chicago group plus cross-posts in two suburban groups, totaling approximately 400 comments across all three posts. We also found that Google had already indexed a cached version of the content through a third-party site that aggregates AWDTSG posts.

<strong>Day 5:</strong> We submitted formal legal documentation through Facebook's legal escalation channel, covering all three posts simultaneously. We also filed a DMCA takedown for Marcus's LinkedIn headshot, which had been used without permission in all three posts.

<strong>Day 9:</strong> The DMCA takedown was processed. Photos removed from all three posts. This reduced engagement on the posts since visual content drives significantly more interaction.

<strong>Day 14:</strong> Facebook's legal team completed review of our defamation documentation. All three posts removed in their entirety. The removal included all comment threads.

<strong>Day 16:</strong> We confirmed Google's cache had been cleared and submitted deindexing requests for the third-party aggregator site. We also initiated <a href="/reputation-monitoring">reputation monitoring</a> to watch for reposts.

<strong>Day 23:</strong> The aggregator site removed its cached content after receiving our legal notice.

<strong>Day 30 and ongoing:</strong> Monitoring confirmed no reposts. Marcus's search results were clean. He reported that his dating life and professional interactions had returned to normal.

<p>Total time from first contact to full resolution: approximately three weeks. Compare that to the months or years that unaddressed AWDTSG posts can continue causing damage.</p>

<h2>The Cross-Platform Problem</h2>

<p>AWDTSG groups don't exist in a Facebook vacuum. Content posted in these groups routinely spreads to other platforms, and each one requires a different removal approach.</p>

<strong>Tea App.</strong> Women who post in AWDTSG groups often post the same content on Tea App, the anonymous dating reputation platform. If you're dealing with AWDTSG posts, there's a meaningful chance similar content exists on Tea App too. <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Our Tea App defamation removal service</a> handles both platforms in coordinated campaigns.

<strong>Instagram Stories and posts.</strong> Screenshots of AWDTSG posts get shared to Instagram, sometimes by the original poster, sometimes by other group members. Instagram's content policies differ from Facebook's, and removal requires platform-specific approaches.

<strong>Reddit and forums.</strong> Subreddits like r/dating and city-specific subreddits occasionally feature discussions referencing AWDTSG posts. Reddit's anonymous structure adds another layer of complexity to removal efforts.

<strong>Google Search results.</strong> Even after content is removed from the source platform, Google's cache and third-party scraper sites can keep the content visible in search results for weeks or months without targeted deindexing efforts.

<p>Comprehensive removal means addressing every platform where content has appeared, not just the original Facebook group post. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. Leaving content on secondary platforms undermines the entire effort.</p>

<h2>What NOT to Do If You Find Yourself in AWDTSG</h2>

<p>The mistakes people make in the first few days often determine how difficult removal becomes. Avoid these at all costs.</p>

<strong>Do not create a fake account to join the group.</strong> Admins are skilled at identifying fake profiles. If you're caught, you'll be publicly outed in the group, which generates an entirely new wave of negative posts about you "trying to infiltrate" the group. This has happened to multiple clients before they reached us.

<strong>Do not confront the poster directly.</strong> Reaching out to the person who posted about you, whether to plead, threaten, or reason with them, almost always backfires. Screenshots of your messages will be shared in the group as evidence of "harassment" or "intimidation," making you look worse and providing new content for engagement.

<strong>Do not have your current partner post a defense.</strong> Well-meaning girlfriends or wives sometimes post in the group defending you. This invariably triggers accusations that you "forced" her to post, that she's been manipulated, or that she'll "find out eventually." It adds fuel without resolving anything.

<strong>Do not threaten legal action in the group.</strong> Vague legal threats posted in comments or conveyed through group members are viewed as intimidation tactics. They rally the group around the original poster and generate sympathy engagement. Actual legal action conducted through proper channels is effective. Bluster in Facebook comments is counterproductive.

<strong>Do document everything immediately.</strong> Screenshot the post, all comments, the poster's profile (if visible), the group name and membership count, and any shares you can identify. This documentation is essential whether you pursue professional removal, legal action, or both.

<h2>When Professional Help Makes Sense</h2>

<p>Not every AWDTSG mention requires professional intervention. If someone posted asking if anyone has dated you and the responses are neutral or positive, that's the system working as intended. If a single comment mentions you briefly in a thread about someone else, the impact may be minimal.</p>

<p>Professional help becomes essential when:</p>

<li>The post contains specific false claims (cheating, abuse, STDs, criminal behavior)</li>
<li>The post has generated significant engagement (50+ comments, multiple shares)</li>
<li>Content has spread to multiple groups or platforms</li>
<li>The post is affecting your professional life (employer concerns, client loss)</li>
<li>Your dating life has been measurably impacted (unmatching, cancellations)</li>
<li>The original poster appears intent on continuing to post about you</li>

<p>If you're dealing with a situation that meets any of these criteria, the window for effective action narrows with each passing day. Every day a post remains active means more comments, more screenshots, more cross-platform sharing, and more people who form permanent impressions based on false information.</p>
