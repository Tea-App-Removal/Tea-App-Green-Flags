        <p>Delaware may be the second-smallest state, but a false AWDTSG post here carries outsized consequences. In a state where nearly everyone in the professional and social scene is connected by just one or two degrees of separation, a defamatory post in a Delaware "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group reaches the people who matter to you almost immediately. Coworkers, neighbors, friends, and professional contacts all overlap in Delaware's intimate communities.</p>

<p>The cross-state dynamics make things worse. Delaware's AWDTSG groups overlap heavily with Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the broader Mid-Atlantic dating scene. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. A post that starts in Wilmington can reach 25,000+ women in the Philly group by morning. Professional removal with ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates is the proven solution.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Delaware</h2>

<p>Delaware's compact geography means fewer groups but concentrated impact. Every group reaches a significant percentage of the state's dating population.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Wilmington/New Castle County</strong> — The largest Delaware group, covering Wilmington, Newark, Bear, Middletown, and the densely populated northern Delaware corridor that connects to Philadelphia</li>
<li><strong>Dover/Central Delaware</strong> — Covering the state capital, Dover Air Force Base community, Smyrna, and Camden</li>
<li><strong>Sussex County/Delaware Beaches</strong> — Serving the Rehoboth Beach, Lewes, Dewey Beach, and Georgetown communities with seasonal membership spikes during summer</li>
<li><strong>Newark/University of Delaware</strong> — Overlapping with the Wilmington group but with distinct college-community dynamics</li>

<p>The Wilmington group's proximity to Philadelphia is the critical factor. Most Wilmington-area residents date across the Delaware-Pennsylvania border, meaning AWDTSG posts routinely cross between Delaware and Philly groups. Similarly, southern Delaware's beach communities overlap with Maryland's Eastern Shore dating scene.</p>

<p>Delaware's status as a corporate hub — with thousands of businesses incorporated in the state — means many AWDTSG targets work in finance, banking, and corporate law where reputation is directly tied to career advancement.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Delaware Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Delaware has 3 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 1.0M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Delaware Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Delaware's legal framework provides solid protections for defamation victims, with some distinctions worth noting. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong>Delaware Code Title 10, § 8119</strong> sets the statute of limitations for defamation at <strong>two years</strong> from the date of publication. Delaware follows common law defamation principles requiring a false statement of fact, publication, fault, and damages.

<p>Delaware recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Accuse someone of a criminal offense</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their business, occupation, or profession</li>
<li>Accuse someone of serious sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, general damages are presumed. Most AWDTSG posts making false accusations of cheating, abuse, or criminal behavior qualify for per se treatment under Delaware law. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.</p>

<p>Delaware's distinction between <strong>public figures and private individuals</strong> is particularly relevant. Most AWDTSG targets are private individuals, meaning they only need to prove negligence (not actual malice) to prevail in a defamation claim. This lower burden of proof strengthens removal leverage.</p>

<strong>Delaware Code Title 11, § 1311</strong> addresses harassment, including electronic harassment through social media. Repeated or targeted AWDTSG posting can constitute harassment under Delaware law.

<p>Delaware courts also recognize <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> claims, including false light and public disclosure of private facts. When AWDTSG posts reveal private information — dating history, personal details, or photographs — without consent, privacy claims provide additional legal leverage.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Delaware</h2>

<p>Our Delaware removal process accounts for the state's small size and the critical cross-state dynamics with Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>

<strong>Multi-State Tracking.</strong> We identify defamatory content across Delaware groups and track spreading to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington DC AWDTSG groups. The I-95 corridor dating overlap requires comprehensive monitoring.

<strong>Delaware Legal Strategy.</strong> Our demands cite Delaware Code Title 10 defamation provisions and applicable per se categories. For corporate professionals, we emphasize the business and professional harm categories that Delaware courts recognize.

<strong>Coordinated Regional Removal.</strong> When posts appear in both Delaware and Pennsylvania groups, we handle simultaneous removal to prevent content from migrating back and forth across state lines.

<strong>Corporate Professional Protection.</strong> Many Delaware AWDTSG targets work in the corporate, banking, and legal sectors. We address professional reputation platforms like LinkedIn and industry forums where AWDTSG content may surface.

<strong>Beach Community Seasonal Monitoring.</strong> Sussex County's beach communities see seasonal AWDTSG spikes. We monitor and respond to posts that emerge during peak summer activity.

<p>Most Delaware removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>

<h2>Delaware Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Del. Code tit. 10 § 8119, Delaware provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Delaware recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Delaware courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in DE county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Del. Code tit. 10 § 8119 and applicable Delaware case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
