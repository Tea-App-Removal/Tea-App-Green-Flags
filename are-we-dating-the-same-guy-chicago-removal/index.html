    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How large is the Chicago AWDTSG group?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Chicago &quot;Are We Dating The Same Guy&quot; Facebook group has over 50,000 members. It is the third-largest AWDTSG group in the United States. The group is women-only, and men cannot view or interact with posts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What legal options do I have in Illinois for a false AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Illinois recognizes defamation per se for false statements imputing criminal behavior, communicable disease, or professional incompetence. You don't need to prove specific financial damages for these categories. The statute of limitations is one year, and private individuals only need to prove the poster acted negligently, not with actual malice."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do posts in the Chicago AWDTSG group spread to suburbs?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. The Chicagoland dating scene extends well beyond Chicago city limits. Posts frequently get shared to AWDTSG groups in Naperville, Evanston, Oak Park, and other suburban communities. Professional removal services address spread across all related groups, not just the main Chicago group."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I remove a Chicago AWDTSG post by reporting it to Facebook?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard Facebook reporting almost never works for AWDTSG posts.

A post in the 50,000-member Chicago group can reach hundreds of women within hours. Screenshots spread to Instagram, Reddit, and suburban groups. In Chicago's tight-knit professional communities, the damage can extend to career and business relationships, not just dating prospects."}}]}

        <p>Your phone won't stop buzzing. A college friend, a coworker, your cousin — all sending the same screenshot. Someone posted your photo in the Chicago "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group with a string of false accusations. Women in Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, and the Loop are reading it right now. The comments section is growing by the minute, and every new reply adds another layer of damage to your reputation in Chicago.</p>

<p>In a city where neighborhoods define your social circles and everyone seems to know everyone, a false AWDTSG post in Chicago can unravel your personal and professional life faster than you thought possible.</p>

<h2>The Chicago AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Chicago" Facebook group has over <strong>50,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view, comment on, or request removal of posts. The group is located at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/315938570542151/">facebook.com/groups/315938570542151/</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 50,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Chicago's AWDTSG group is the third-largest in the country, reflecting the city's massive and active dating scene. From the bars along Rush Street to the coffee shops of Logan Square, Chicago's dating culture is deeply social and word-of-mouth driven. Unlike cities where people move constantly, Chicago has a loyal, rooted population — which means a false post doesn't just reach strangers. It reaches people in your actual orbit.</p>

<p>Apps like Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder dominate Chicago's dating landscape, and AWDTSG has become a de facto screening tool. Women routinely search the group before agreeing to a date with someone they matched with online. If your name and photo are already there, attached to false accusations, your dating life in Chicago effectively ends until the post is removed.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Chicago AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 72,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Chicago</h2>

<p>Chicago's neighborhood-driven social structure creates a unique pattern of spread. People in Lakeview socialize with people in Lincoln Park. River North crowds overlap with Gold Coast circles. Wicker Park connects to Logan Square and Bucktown. A single AWDTSG post in Chicago sends ripples across the entire North Side and beyond.</p>

<p>The typical spread pattern in Chicago:</p>

<li><strong>Neighborhood group chats</strong> — Women share screenshots with friends in their specific Chicago neighborhoods, creating localized buzz that extends outward</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Stories and DMs</strong> — Screenshots with names and photos circulate visually across the city's social media landscape</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to suburban groups</strong> — Naperville, Evanston, Oak Park, and other suburban AWDTSG groups share significant overlap with Chicago's dating pool</li>
<li><strong>Reddit discussions</strong> on r/ChicagoDating and related forums amplify the conversation outside Facebook</li>
<li><strong>Workplace gossip</strong> — In a city with concentrated business districts like the Loop and River North, professional circles overlap heavily with dating circles</li>

<p>Chicago's social density means the same post can reach your Tinder matches, your coworker's girlfriend, your neighbor's friend, and your client's daughter — all within the same 24-hour period. The city's tight-knit communities make containment nearly impossible without professional intervention.</p>

<h2>Illinois Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Illinois provides strong legal protections against defamation. Under Illinois common law and the Illinois Constitution's free speech provisions, defamation claims require proof that a false statement of fact was published to a third party and caused reputational harm.</p>

<p>Key points about <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?ActID=2017&ChapterID=56&SeqStart=62200000&SeqEnd=63600000">Illinois defamation law</a> for Chicago residents:</p>

<li><strong>Defamation per se</strong> applies in Illinois when statements falsely impute the commission of a criminal offense, infection with a communicable disease, inability to perform professional duties, or lack of integrity in one's profession — no proof of special damages required</li>
<li><strong>Illinois statute of limitations</strong> for defamation is one year from publication</li>
<li><strong>Illinois courts</strong> recognize online publication, including Facebook group posts, as meeting the publication requirement for defamation</li>
<li><strong>Actual malice</strong> is not required for private individuals — you only need to show negligence on the part of the poster</li>
<li><strong>Section 230</strong> protects Facebook but not the individual who wrote the defamatory post about you in Chicago</li>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> leverage Illinois defamation law to create legal pressure that moves through Facebook's compliance channels rather than the standard reporting system that rarely produces results.

<h2>Professional Removal for Chicago AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Facebook's built-in reporting tools are ineffective against Chicago AWDTSG posts. The group's admins view removal requests as men trying to "silence" warnings, and standard reports get automatically rejected by Facebook's moderation algorithms. Contacting the poster directly — or having someone do it on your behalf — almost always triggers a follow-up post that doubles the exposure.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> handle Chicago cases through a proven process:

<strong>Comprehensive Mapping</strong> — We identify every location the post exists: the Chicago AWDTSG group, suburban groups across the Chicagoland area, Instagram reposts, Reddit threads, and Google search results.

<strong>Legal Documentation</strong> — We prepare formal notices under Illinois defamation law and submit them through Facebook's legal compliance team, bypassing the ineffective standard reporting pipeline.

<strong>Coordinated Removal</strong> — We address the original post, all derivatives across platforms, and any search engine indexing simultaneously.

<strong>Post-Removal Surveillance</strong> — We monitor the Chicago AWDTSG group and Chicagoland-area groups for any reposting attempts after the initial removal.

<p>Removal for Chicago clients typically completes within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> with a success rate of <strong>92-95%</strong>. Given that the Chicago group has 50,000+ active members, quick action prevents the exponential spread that occurs with every passing day.</p>

<p>If your post has also appeared on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App or other dating platforms</a>, we coordinate removal across all platforms simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Time Is Not on Your Side in Chicago</h2>

<p>Every day that a post stays active in the 50,000-member Chicago AWDTSG group, more women see it, more screenshots get saved, and more conversations happen in bars and coffee shops across Chicago's neighborhoods. The compounding effect is real — what starts as one post on a Monday can become common knowledge in your social circles by Friday.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Chicago "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group, act now:</p>

<li><strong>Get screenshots immediately</strong> — Have someone you trust capture the post, comments, and the poster's profile before anything changes</li>
<li><strong>Do not respond to the poster</strong> — Any communication, direct or indirect, escalates the situation in Chicago's connected community</li>
<li><strong>Stay off social media</strong> — Posting about the situation draws more attention to the AWDTSG post</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Reach out to professional removal experts today</a></strong> — The first 48 hours are critical for limiting spread</li>

<p>False accusations in the Chicago AWDTSG group don't have to define your reputation. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get professional removal started now</a>.</p>
