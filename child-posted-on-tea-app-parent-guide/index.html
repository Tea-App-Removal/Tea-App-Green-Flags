        <div class="meta">By Legal Team · 2026-02-07</div>
        <p>A mother in suburban Chicago called us on a Tuesday evening, barely holding it together. Her sixteen-year-old daughter had come home from school in tears because classmates were passing around screenshots of a Tea App post that included her daughter's full name, a photo pulled from her Instagram, and a string of fabricated accusations about her dating behavior. The daughter is a junior in high school. She has never used Tea App. She has never been on a date. But someone -- likely a peer with a grudge -- created a post on a platform designed for adults to review dating partners, and now a minor child's name and face were circulating alongside false claims about sexual activity and dishonesty.</p>

<p>This scenario is more common than most parents realize, and it represents one of the most legally actionable situations in the entire online defamation landscape. If your child has been posted on Tea App or a similar platform, you have powerful legal tools at your disposal -- tools that are significantly stronger than what's available to adult victims. Platforms take content involving minors more seriously. Federal law is on your side. State laws in many jurisdictions add additional protections. And professional removal services consistently achieve faster results for cases involving children than for any other category.</p>

<p>But you need to act quickly and correctly. Here is what you need to know and exactly what to do.</p>

<h2>Why Minors Are Appearing on Tea App and AWDTSG Groups</h2>

<p>Tea App was designed as a platform where adults can share dating experiences and warn others about potentially dangerous partners. The "Are We Dating the Same Guy" (AWDTSG) Facebook groups serve a similar purpose. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. Neither platform was built for or intended to involve minors. But that hasn't stopped it from happening.</p>

<p>There are three common scenarios where minors end up on these platforms. The first involves teenage social conflicts that spill onto adult platforms. High schoolers who discover Tea App through older siblings or social media posts use it to publicly shame classmates they're in conflict with. The second involves adults who unknowingly date someone under eighteen and then post about the experience, sometimes revealing the minor's identity in the process. The third, and most troubling, involves deliberate harassment by adults targeting a teenager, often in retaliation against the minor's parent.</p>

<p>In the Chicago case I mentioned, the post was traced to a group of classmates who thought it would be "funny" to put a peer's name on a dating review platform. They didn't understand -- or didn't care -- that they were committing acts with serious legal consequences. In another case we handled in Texas, a man's ex-wife posted his seventeen-year-old son on Tea App with false accusations about aggressive behavior toward girls at school, as part of an escalating custody dispute. The son had no involvement in any dating platform and was devastated when friends began sending him screenshots.</p>

<p>Regardless of how your child ended up on Tea App, the legal framework for removal is substantially in your favor.</p>

<h2>Federal Protections: COPPA and What It Means for Your Case</h2>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, is the foundational federal law protecting children's online privacy. COPPA applies to commercial websites and online services that collect personal information from children under thirteen, but its principles extend broadly to how platforms handle all minor-related content.</p>

<p>Under COPPA, platforms that knowingly collect, use, or display personal information of children under thirteen without verifiable parental consent face significant penalties. The FTC has levied fines exceeding $275 million against companies that violated COPPA, including a landmark $170 million penalty against YouTube in 2019 for collecting children's data without parental consent. In 2023, Epic Games agreed to pay $275 million in COPPA violations related to Fortnite.</p>

<p>Now, here's where this gets practical for your situation. Tea App is not a children's platform and does not market itself to users under eighteen. When a minor's personal information, including their name, photo, school, or any identifying details, appears on Tea App, the platform faces potential COPPA exposure if they fail to remove it promptly after being notified. This gives your removal request significantly more weight than a standard adult defamation claim.</p>

<p>For children between thirteen and seventeen, COPPA's direct protections are narrower, but platform liability concerns remain substantial. Tea App's own terms of service restrict the platform to users eighteen and older. Any content featuring, identifying, or discussing a minor is a terms-of-service violation by definition. Platforms are generally much more responsive to removal requests that they can frame as terms-of-service enforcement rather than editorial judgment calls about defamation claims.</p>

<p>When professional services handle removal requests for content involving minors, they bring together multiple legal protections into a comprehensive case that produces faster results than any single approach alone. The expertise required to effectively coordinate these protections is why professional removal consistently outperforms individual efforts.</p>

<h2>State Privacy Laws That Protect Your Child</h2>

<p>Federal law provides a baseline, but several states have enacted privacy protections for minors that go well beyond COPPA. If you live in one of these states or your child was posted by someone in one of these states, you have additional legal leverage.</p>

<strong>California (CalOPPA and the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act).</strong> California leads the nation in children's digital privacy protections. The California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, which took effect in 2024, requires online platforms to consider the best interests of child users and to provide the highest level of privacy protections by default for users under eighteen. California also has a specific "eraser law" (SB 568) that gives minors the right to request removal of content they posted -- though this is more directly relevant when the minor themselves used the platform. For third-party posts about minors, California's broad privacy protections and the state's aggressive enforcement posture through the Attorney General's office create meaningful pressure on platforms to comply with removal requests.

<strong>Illinois (BIPA and Student Online Personal Protection Act).</strong> Illinois has some of the most aggressive digital privacy enforcement in the country. The Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) applies when photos of minors are used without consent, as facial geometry is considered biometric data under the statute. If someone posted your child's photo on Tea App without your consent, BIPA may apply. Illinois also enacted the Student Online Personal Protection Act, which restricts how online services can use student data. Violations carry statutory damages of $1,000 per incident, creating real financial exposure for platforms that drag their feet on removal.

<strong>Texas (CUBI Act and Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment Act).</strong> Texas passed the Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment (SCOPE) Act, which requires platforms to verify ages and provide parental controls. Texas also enacted the Capturing Unlawful Use of Biometric Identifiers (CUBI) Act. Like Illinois's BIPA, this law creates liability when a minor's biometric data (including facial geometry from photos) is collected or used without parental consent.

<strong>Other states with strong minor protections.</strong> Connecticut, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Montana have all enacted comprehensive data privacy laws with specific provisions for minors. New York's CHILD Act, signed in 2024, restricts how platforms can use minors' data and requires platforms to provide protective defaults for accounts belonging to users under eighteen.

<p>The practical impact of these state laws is significant. When we file removal requests citing specific state statute violations, platforms respond faster because the potential liability is concrete and quantifiable. A $1,000 per-incident statutory damage provision in Illinois or a potential BIPA claim in Texas transforms a removal request from "please take this down" to "you have specific legal exposure that grows every day this content remains live."</p>

<h2>Tea App's Own Policies on Content Involving Minors</h2>

<p>Tea App's terms of service explicitly restrict the platform to users aged eighteen and older. The platform's community guidelines prohibit content that identifies, targets, or involves minors. These aren't buried in legal fine print; they're core platform policies that Tea App's trust and safety team is trained to enforce.</p>

<p>When a post involves a minor, Tea App has a direct policy basis for removal that doesn't require them to make subjective judgments about whether content is "defamatory" or constitutes a "policy violation" in some ambiguous way. A post that names, depicts, or discusses a minor is a clear violation. Period.</p>

<p>However, the speed and reliability of Tea App's response to reports involving minors varies significantly depending on how the report is filed and what documentation accompanies it. A standard in-app report may sit in a queue for days or weeks. Professional removal requests are handled on a completely different timeline.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> provide the most dramatic advantage over DIY approaches. Our team has developed proven processes for minor-related removal that consistently achieve results in a fraction of the time it takes for standard reports to be processed.</p>

<h2>Additional Legal Protections for Your Child's Photos</h2>

<p>When a Tea App post includes photographs of your child, additional legal protections beyond privacy and defamation law may apply. The specifics depend on who took the photos, how they were obtained, and other circumstances unique to your situation.</p>

<p>These additional legal avenues can be powerful tools for removal, but they must be used correctly. Improperly filed claims can carry legal consequences and may even delay removal. The intersection of copyright law, privacy law, and platform policies creates complexity that benefits from professional guidance.</p>

<p>For situations where Tea App content has spread to other platforms, such as <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Facebook's AWDTSG groups</a> or Instagram, a coordinated multi-platform approach is essential. Professional services handle the complexity of simultaneous removal across platforms, ensuring comprehensive cleanup.</p>

<h2>Why Standard Reporting Often Fails -- Even for Content Involving Minors</h2>

<p>Standard in-app reporting fails more often than it succeeds, even for content involving minors. Tea App's standard reporting system is not designed to handle the legal complexity of minor privacy cases. If your initial report to Tea App doesn't result in removal within 48 to 72 hours, the situation requires professional escalation.</p>

<p>The challenge is that effective escalation requires knowing the right channels, the right documentation, the right legal framing, and the right sequence of actions. Each step must be executed correctly, because missteps can actually delay removal or weaken your position. The escalation process for cases involving minors is particularly complex because it spans multiple regulatory bodies, platform policies, and legal frameworks.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="/tea-app-emergency-removal">professional removal services</a> provide the most critical advantage. Our team can begin working on your case within 24 hours. For cases involving minors, we have established processes that consistently produce faster results than any combination of individual efforts, leveraging expertise developed through handling hundreds of similar cases.</p>

<h2>What to Tell Your Child While the Post Is Still Up</h2>

<p>The legal and logistical aspects of removing a Tea App post about your child are critical, but so is the emotional reality your child is facing. Teenagers who discover they've been posted on an adult dating review platform experience a particular kind of humiliation that hits at the core of adolescent identity and social belonging.</p>

<p>Here's what I recommend based on working with dozens of families in this situation.</p>

<strong>Acknowledge the seriousness.</strong> Don't minimize what's happening. "Just ignore it" or "it'll blow over" feels dismissive to a teenager who is seeing their name and face circulating among classmates alongside false sexual or behavioral claims. Acknowledge that this is a real problem, that it's not their fault, and that you're taking concrete steps to fix it.

<strong>Be specific about what you're doing.</strong> Teenagers feel powerless in these situations. Telling them "we're handling it" is less reassuring than "I've filed a legal removal request with the platform, I've contacted a professional removal service, and I've consulted with an attorney about our options. Here's the timeline we're working with." Concrete actions and timelines reduce anxiety more than vague reassurances.

<strong>Address the social fallout directly.</strong> Talk to your child about what to say if classmates bring up the post. A simple, confident response like "Someone posted false information about me and it's being removed" is better than no response plan. Role-play the conversation if your child is anxious about it. Consider whether their school counselor or administration should be informed, particularly if the post originated from classmates, as this may constitute cyberbullying that falls under school disciplinary policies, which <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it">StopBullying.gov</a> defines as bullying that takes place over digital devices.

<strong>Monitor their mental health.</strong> Online harassment of minors is linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, self-harm. The American Psychological Association's 2024 report on social media and youth mental health found that adolescents who experienced online harassment were three times more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression than peers who hadn't. If your child's emotional response seems disproportionate or prolonged, professional counseling is appropriate and valuable. This isn't weakness; it's responsible parenting in a situation that would distress any adult, let alone a teenager.

<h2>Can You Sue the Person Who Posted About Your Child?</h2>

<p>Yes, and cases involving minors are among the strongest defamation claims available. Several legal theories apply.</p>

<strong>Defamation.</strong> False statements of fact about a minor, published to third parties, that cause harm meet the standard elements of defamation. Courts are particularly sympathetic to defamation claims involving minor victims, and several jurisdictions have awarded significant damages in cases involving online defamation of children.

<strong>Invasion of privacy.</strong> Publishing a minor's personal information on a public platform without parental consent may constitute invasion of privacy, specifically the tort of "public disclosure of private facts" or "intrusion upon seclusion" depending on the jurisdiction and circumstances.

<strong>Intentional infliction of emotional distress.</strong> Posting a minor on an adult dating review platform with false accusations could constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress, particularly when the poster knew or should have known the subject was a minor.

<strong>Negligent infliction of emotional distress.</strong> Even if the poster didn't know the subject was a minor, posting about someone without verifying their age on a platform designed for adults may constitute negligence.

<strong>Cyberbullying statutes.</strong> If the poster is also a minor, most states have cyberbullying laws that apply. These can result in school discipline, juvenile court involvement, and in some states, civil liability for the minor's parents.

<p>Lawsuits take time and money, so they're typically not the fastest path to content removal. But for cases where a child has been seriously harmed, legal action serves the dual purpose of obtaining financial compensation and creating a deterrent against future harassment. Many families pursue <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> to get the content down quickly while simultaneously consulting with an attorney about legal action for accountability and damages.</p>

<h2>Working With Your Child's School</h2>

<p>If the post originated from classmates, or if the post is circulating among students at your child's school, involving the school administration is often both necessary and effective.</p>

<p>Most school districts have anti-cyberbullying policies that apply to off-campus conduct when it affects the school environment. The post circulating among students during school hours and on school grounds almost certainly meets this threshold. Depending on your district's policies, consequences for the students involved can include suspension, expulsion, or mandated counseling.</p>

<p>Bring your documentation to a meeting with the principal or vice principal. Present the post, evidence that it involves a minor student, evidence that it's circulating among students, and any impact it's having on your child's school experience. Schools have a legal obligation to address harassment that affects the educational environment, and cyberbullying that follows a student into the classroom triggers that obligation.</p>

<p>Some schools will also involve their legal counsel, which can be an additional channel for pressuring platform removal. A letter from a school district's attorney demanding removal of content that depicts a minor student carries institutional weight.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Ongoing Protection With Reputation Monitoring</h2>

<p>After the immediate post is removed, the threat isn't over. Content involving minors is sometimes reposted, screenshots continue circulating, and in some cases, the original poster or their associates create new posts. <a href="/reputation-monitoring">Reputation monitoring services</a> provide ongoing surveillance of Tea App, Facebook groups, Instagram, and other platforms where your child's name might appear.</p>

<p>For families who've dealt with a minor being posted on Tea App, monitoring serves as an early warning system. When new content is detected, removal can begin immediately -- before the post gains engagement and spreads. The difference between catching a post at 5 comments versus 500 comments is the difference between a 48-hour removal and a two-week removal involving multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Monitoring also provides peace of mind during a period that is intensely stressful for both parents and children. Knowing that someone is watching for new content so you don't have to constantly check yourself reduces the hypervigilance that many parents experience after their child is targeted online.</p>

<h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>

<p>If your minor child has been posted on Tea App or an AWDTSG Facebook group, here's your immediate action plan.</p>

<p>First, document everything. Screenshot the post, all comments, engagement metrics, and any evidence of cross-platform spread. Do this before anything else because posts can be edited or deleted, and you need a complete record.</p>

<p>Second, do not let your child engage with the post. No comments, no messages to the poster, no asking friends to report or respond. Engagement amplifies the content and makes removal harder.</p>

<p>Third, if the content is severely damaging, spreading rapidly, or causing your child significant distress, contact our team for <a href="/tea-app-emergency-removal">emergency removal</a>. Cases involving minors receive priority handling, and we can typically begin the removal process within 24 hours of initial contact. Our team will identify every legal protection available in your situation and pursue the most effective approach.</p>

<p>Fourth, if the post originated from classmates, contact your child's school with documentation. School-based consequences for the posters may be appropriate and can deter future incidents.</p>

<p>Your child didn't ask to be part of an adult dating review platform. The law recognizes that minors deserve heightened protection from exactly this kind of exposure. The legal tools available to you as a parent are stronger than what adult victims have access to, and the platforms know it. Use that leverage aggressively, act quickly, and get professional help if the DIY approach isn't producing results within 48 to 72 hours. Every day that content remains live is a day your child walks into school knowing their classmates may be reading false accusations about them on the internet. That's a situation no parent should tolerate longer than absolutely necessary.</p>
