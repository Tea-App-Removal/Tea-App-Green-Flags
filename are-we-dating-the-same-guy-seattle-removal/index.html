It covers Seattle proper, Bellevue, Kirkland, Tacoma, and the broader Puget Sound region. The group is women-only and men cannot view or interact with posts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a Seattle AWDTSG post affect my tech career?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Seattle's tech industry creates extremely dense overlapping social and professional networks. A false AWDTSG post can reach colleagues, managers, and professional contacts through informal sharing. Tech company internal channels (Slack, Teams) sometimes carry AWDTSG-related discussions that can impact your professional standing."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What protections does Washington State law provide?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Washington State recognizes defamation per se for false statements imputing criminal conduct, sexual misconduct, and professional harm. Special damages don't need to be proven for these categories. Washington has a favorable two-year statute of limitations, giving you more time to pursue legal remedies than in most states."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do Seattle AWDTSG posts spread to Portland and the Eastside?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. The Pacific Northwest dating market connects Seattle with Bellevue, Kirkland, Tacoma, and Portland. Posts regularly get shared across AWDTSG groups in these areas. Professional removal services address all related groups across the Pacific Northwest."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to remove a Seattle AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Professional removal services typically complete Seattle AWDTSG removals within 30 to 90 days. The process uses legal documentation submitted through Facebook's compliance channels, which is dramatically more effective than standard reporting. Washington's two-year statute of limitations provides additional legal leverage."}}]}

        <p>A coworker pulled you aside after a meeting. "I don't know how to say this, but my girlfriend showed me something last night." A screenshot from the Seattle "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group. Your photo, your name, and a story that bears no resemblance to reality. Women in Capitol Hill, Ballard, and Fremont are reading it right now. In Seattle's tech-driven, socially conscious dating scene, a false accusation spreads with the efficiency of a viral product launch. You need help, and you need it tonight.</p>

<p>Seattle's unique combination of tech industry density and Pacific Northwest social culture creates a dating environment where online reputation is everything. A false AWDTSG post here doesn't just disrupt your love life — it can reach your colleagues at Amazon, Microsoft, or any number of startups before the end of the week.</p>

<h2>The Seattle AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Seattle" Facebook group has over <strong>23,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, comment, or request removal. The group is at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/1042189616652224/">facebook.com/groups/1042189616652224/</a>. All content is subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a> and their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 23,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Seattle's AWDTSG group covers a dating market that extends from the city proper through Bellevue, Kirkland, Tacoma, and the broader Puget Sound region. With Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, and a thriving startup ecosystem driving the local economy, the group has a high concentration of educated, tech-savvy members who engage actively with posts.</p>

<p>Hinge and Bumble dominate Seattle's dating scene, with Coffee Meets Bagel and The League also popular among the city's professional demographic. AWDTSG has become an essential pre-date screening tool in Seattle, where the dating culture is notoriously cautious. If your name is in the group attached to false accusations, breaking through Seattle's dating scene becomes nearly impossible.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Seattle AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 28,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Seattle</h2>

<p>Seattle's social dynamics combine big-city tech culture with a surprisingly small-town feel. The "Seattle Freeze" paradox — difficulty making new connections in a city full of transplants — means the social connections that do exist are tight and closely guarded. Once you're labeled in AWDTSG, that label sticks.</p>

<p>How AWDTSG posts typically spread in Seattle:</p>

<li><strong>Tech company Slack channels and internal social groups</strong> — Seattle's massive tech workforce uses Slack for everything, and AWDTSG screenshots make their way into workplace-adjacent channels</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> circulate through Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, and Ballard's social scenes</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to Portland, Tacoma, and Eastside groups</strong> — The Pacific Northwest dating market connects Seattle with Portland, Bellevue, and surrounding communities</li>
<li><strong>Reddit threads</strong> — Seattle has an active Reddit community, and AWDTSG-related discussions appear on r/Seattle and r/SeattleWA</li>
<li><strong>Activity-based communities</strong> — Seattle's hiking, climbing, and outdoor recreation groups create social networks that carry AWDTSG information beyond dating circles</li>

<p>Seattle's tech industry concentration makes this particularly dangerous for professionals. Amazon's South Lake Union campus, Microsoft's Redmond headquarters, and Meta's Bellevue offices create concentrated professional communities where a dating reputation crisis can become a workplace conversation. The crossover between personal and professional life in Seattle's tech corridor is significant.</p>

<h2>Washington State Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Washington State provides meaningful legal protections against defamation under RCW 7.96 and common law principles.</p>

<p>Key aspects of <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=7.96">Washington defamation law</a> for Seattle residents:</p>

<li><strong>Defamation per se</strong> in Washington covers false statements imputing criminal conduct, a loathsome disease, sexual misconduct, or harm to business or profession — no special damages required</li>
<li><strong>Washington's statute of limitations</strong> for defamation is two years from publication</li>
<li><strong>Washington's anti-SLAPP statute</strong> (Uniform Public Expression Protection Act) provides some protections but does not shield provably false statements of fact</li>
<li><strong>General and special damages</strong> are available, with general damages presumed in per se cases</li>
<li><strong>Washington courts</strong> recognize online publication, including social media, as meeting defamation requirements</li>

<p>Washington's two-year statute of limitations gives <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> additional leverage and timeline flexibility when pursuing removal through Facebook's legal channels for Seattle clients.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Seattle AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Standard Facebook reporting doesn't work for Seattle AWDTSG posts. The group's admins reject removal requests from anyone perceived as defending the subject of a post. Automated systems don't flag the content. Reaching out to the poster — especially in Seattle's socially cautious culture — triggers defensive responses and often a follow-up post.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> approach Seattle cases with a Pacific Northwest strategy:

<strong>Puget Sound Assessment</strong> — We identify every instance of the post across the Seattle AWDTSG group, Eastside, Tacoma, and Portland groups, Instagram reposts, Reddit threads, and Google search results.

<strong>Washington Legal Framework</strong> — We prepare formal documentation under Washington defamation law, citing the two-year statute of limitations and per se categories, for submission through Facebook's legal compliance channels.

<strong>Tech-Aware Cleanup</strong> — Understanding that Seattle spread includes tech company internal channels, we pursue comprehensive removal across all accessible platforms.

<strong>Post-Removal Monitoring</strong> — After removal, we watch the Seattle AWDTSG group and Pacific Northwest groups for reposting.

<p>Seattle removals typically complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong>. In a city where tech company networks amplify personal reputation damage, professional intervention early in the timeline prevents the widest professional crossover.</p>

<p>For content on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App or other platforms</a>, we handle all removals as part of a coordinated strategy.</p>

<h2>Seattle's Small World Means You Can't Wait</h2>

<p>With 23,000+ members and a tech industry that creates dense professional-social networks, the Seattle AWDTSG group has outsized influence. Every day the post stays active, it penetrates deeper into the overlapping communities that define your life in the Puget Sound region — your work, your social circle, your neighborhood.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Seattle "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group:</p>

<li><strong>Get documentation through a trusted contact</strong> — Screenshot the post, all comments, and any identifying information about the poster</li>
<li><strong>Do not contact the poster</strong> — Seattle's cautious social culture means any contact will be interpreted as threatening behavior and documented</li>
<li><strong>Assess your professional exposure</strong> — If you work in tech in Seattle, the professional reputation impact is a real and urgent concern</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services immediately</a></strong> — In a city where professional and personal networks are this intertwined, speed matters</li>

<p>Your reputation in Seattle — personal and professional — is worth protecting. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start professional AWDTSG removal now</a>.</p>
