        <p>A single post in an Alabama "Are We Dating the Same Guy" Facebook group can reach thousands of women across the state in hours. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. If someone has posted your name and photo with false accusations in an Alabama AWDTSG group, your reputation is actively being damaged right now. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a> found 41% of Americans have experienced online harassment. Every hour that post stays up means more screenshots, more shares, and more people associating your name with lies.</p>

<p>Alabama's AWDTSG groups are growing fast, and the damage they cause is real. But Alabama law provides strong protections against defamation, and professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates. You have options, and acting quickly makes all the difference.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Alabama</h2>

<p>"Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups have spread to every major metro area in Alabama. These Facebook groups operate as women-only spaces where members post photos and names of men they've dated or encountered on dating apps. While the stated purpose is safety, these groups frequently become vehicles for false accusations, revenge posts, and unverified claims that destroy reputations.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Birmingham</strong> — The largest Alabama group with over 6,000 members, covering the greater Birmingham metro including Hoover, Vestavia Hills, Homewood, and Mountain Brook</li>
<li><strong>Huntsville</strong> — Rapidly growing group serving the Huntsville-Decatur metro area and the Redstone Arsenal community</li>
<li><strong>Montgomery</strong> — Active group covering the state capital and surrounding areas including Prattville and Millbrook</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> — Covering the Gulf Coast region including Daphne, Fairhope, and Spanish Fort</li>
<li><strong>Tuscaloosa</strong> — University-adjacent group with high activity during football season and academic terms</li>
<li><strong>Auburn/Opelika</strong> — Serving the Auburn University community and Lee County area</li>
<li><strong>Dothan</strong> — Covering the Wiregrass region of southeast Alabama</li>
<li><strong>Florence/Muscle Shoals</strong> — Serving the Shoals area of northwest Alabama</li>

<p>Posts in the Birmingham group alone can reach thousands of women within a single day. Screenshots from Alabama groups regularly get shared to groups in neighboring states like Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Florida, multiplying the damage far beyond Alabama's borders.</p>

<h2>Alabama Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Alabama provides some of the strongest legal protections against defamation in the Southeast. Understanding these laws gives you real leverage when pursuing post removal.</p>

<strong>Alabama Code § 6-5-180 through § 6-5-189</strong> governs defamation actions in the state. Alabama recognizes both libel (written defamation, which includes social media posts) and slander. Under Alabama law, a defamation plaintiff must prove that the defendant published a false statement of fact about the plaintiff to a third party, and that the statement caused damage to the plaintiff's reputation.

<p>Alabama is particularly favorable for defamation victims because the state recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> — certain categories of false statements are considered so inherently damaging that you don't need to prove specific financial losses. These categories include false accusations of:</p>

<li>Criminal behavior</li>
<li>Sexual misconduct</li>
<li>Conduct incompatible with your business or profession</li>
<li>Having a loathsome disease</li>

<p>Many AWDTSG posts fall squarely into these per se categories, making Alabama an advantageous jurisdiction for pursuing removal through legal channels.</p>

<strong>Alabama Code § 13A-11-8</strong> addresses criminal defamation, and while criminal prosecutions are rare, the existence of this statute adds additional legal weight to removal demands. Alabama courts have also recognized invasion of privacy claims under <strong>Alabama Code § 6-5-770</strong>, which can apply when AWDTSG posts expose private information without consent.

<p>The statute of limitations for defamation in Alabama is <strong>two years</strong> from the date of publication under <strong>Alabama Code § 6-2-38</strong>. However, each new share or reposting of defamatory content can restart this clock, giving you extended legal options for removal.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Alabama</h2>

<p>Our Alabama AWDTSG removal process leverages the state's strong defamation protections to achieve fast, effective results. Here's how we handle removal for Alabama clients:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Documentation and Assessment.</strong> We identify every instance of the defamatory content across Facebook groups, screenshot archives, and other platforms. We assess the scope of damage including cross-platform spreading to Instagram, Reddit, and Google search results.

<strong>Step 2: Legal Demand Preparation.</strong> Our team prepares formal legal documentation citing Alabama's specific defamation statutes. These aren't template letters — they reference the exact provisions of Alabama Code that apply to your situation, including per se defamation categories and privacy violations.

<strong>Step 3: Platform-Level Removal.</strong> We submit removal requests through Facebook's legal channels, not the standard reporting system that rarely works for AWDTSG posts. Our legal documentation creates genuine liability concerns that Facebook's legal team takes seriously.

<strong>Step 4: Cross-Platform Cleanup.</strong> We track and remove screenshots and discussions that have spread to other platforms. This includes working with search engines to deindex cached content that appears in Google results for your name.

<strong>Step 5: Monitoring and Protection.</strong> After removal, we monitor Alabama AWDTSG groups and other platforms for reposting attempts. If content reappears, we act immediately to remove it before it gains traction.

<p>Most Alabama AWDTSG removals are completed within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong>, with a success rate between ninety-two and ninety-five percent. The strength of Alabama's defamation laws often accelerates the process compared to states with weaker protections.</p>

<h2>Act Now Before the Damage Spreads</h2>

<p>Every day an AWDTSG post remains active in an Alabama group, more women see it, more screenshots get captured, and more platforms index the content. The tight-knit nature of Alabama's dating communities means false information spreads quickly between cities and into neighboring states.</p>

<p>Don't try to handle this alone. Contacting group admins directly, commenting on posts to defend yourself, or having friends report the content almost always makes things worse. Professional removal through proper legal channels is the proven approach that actually works.</p>

<p>Your reputation in Alabama matters — for your career, your relationships, and your peace of mind. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get started with professional AWDTSG removal today</a>.</p>



<h2>Alabama Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Ala. Code § 6-5-180, Alabama provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Alabama recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Alabama courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in AL county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Ala. Code § 6-5-180 and applicable Alabama case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
