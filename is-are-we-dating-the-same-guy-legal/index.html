However, individual posts within these groups frequently cross legal lines. False statements of fact constitute defamation. Sharing private intimate information can violate privacy laws. Using someone's photo without consent may violate right of publicity laws. The group's existence is legal, but much of what happens inside it is not."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does the First Amendment protect AWDTSG posts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The First Amendment protects opinions and truthful statements, but it does not protect false statements of fact, defamation, invasion of privacy, harassment, or doxing. Most problematic AWDTSG posts contain provably false factual claims that fall outside First Amendment protection. The First Amendment is not a license to publish false and damaging information about private individuals."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What privacy torts apply to AWDTSG posts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Four main privacy torts may apply to AWDTSG posts. Public disclosure of private facts covers sharing private information like sexual details or medical conditions. False light covers portraying someone in a misleading way. Intrusion upon seclusion covers obtaining private information through improper means. Appropriation of likeness covers using someone's photo without consent for the poster's purposes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can AWDTSG posts violate anti-doxing laws?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Many states have enacted anti-doxing statutes that prohibit publishing someone's personal identifying information with the intent to harass, threaten, or intimidate. The D'Ambrosio case in Illinois successfully used the Illinois Anti-Doxing Act against an AWDTSG poster. AWDTSG posts that include full names, workplaces, neighborhoods, or other identifying details may violate these laws depending on your state."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is sharing someone's dating profile in AWDTSG a privacy violation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This depends on context and jurisdiction. Dating profile information shared on public or semi-public dating apps has a lower expectation of privacy. However, sharing screenshots of private messages, personal photos not from dating apps, or information obtained through private communications may constitute a privacy violation. The key question is whether the information was truly public or obtained through a relationship of trust."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue for invasion of privacy over an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, if the post meets the elements of one or more privacy torts. Public disclosure of private facts requires showing the poster shared private information that a reasonable person would find highly offensive and that is not of legitimate public concern. False light requires showing the post portrays you in a false and highly offensive manner. Consult a privacy attorney to evaluate your specific post."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does [Section 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) prevent legal action against AWDTSG posters?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Section 230 protects platforms like Facebook from liability for user-generated content, but it provides zero protection to the individuals who create and post content. The person who writes a defamatory or privacy-violating AWDTSG post is fully liable for their actions. Section 230 is not a defense for individual posters."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between legal and actionable AWDTSG content?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Some AWDTSG content is both legal and non-actionable, such as truthful opinions about dating experiences. Other content is illegal and actionable, including false statements of fact, private information disclosure, and doxing. The distinction matters because even when the group itself is legal, specific posts may create civil or even criminal liability for the poster."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are there state laws specifically targeting AWDTSG-type groups?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While no state has enacted legislation specifically targeting AWDTSG groups, several existing state laws apply directly. These include anti-doxing statutes (like Illinois'), cyberbullying and cyber harassment laws, revenge porn and intimate image laws, and enhanced defamation statutes. Legislative attention to AWDTSG groups is increasing, and new bills are being introduced in multiple states."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if my privacy was violated by an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"First, preserve all evidence by screenshotting the post and any shares. Do not engage with the poster or the group. Contact a professional removal service to begin the removal process immediately — most achieve removal within 30 to 90 days. Simultaneously, consult with a privacy or defamation attorney to evaluate your legal options for damages. Time is critical because the longer the post remains, the more your privacy is compromised."}}]}

        <p>"Is Are We Dating the Same Guy legal?" It's the first question many men ask when they discover their name, photo, and a string of false accusations have been broadcast to thousands of strangers in a Facebook group they didn't even know existed. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The answer is nuanced — and more favorable to you than you might expect.</p>

<p>The AWDTSG groups themselves are legal to create and operate. Facebook allows them, and there is no law against forming a discussion group about dating. But the <strong>content posted within these groups</strong> is an entirely different legal question. And the answer is clear: much of what happens inside AWDTSG groups violates defamation law, privacy law, anti-doxing statutes, and other legal protections that exist specifically to protect people like you.</p>

<p>Understanding the legal landscape is essential — not just for evaluating whether you can take legal action, but for understanding why professional removal services are so effective at getting posts taken down.</p>

<h2>The First Amendment: What It Protects and What It Doesn't</h2>

<p>AWDTSG defenders frequently invoke the First Amendment as a blanket shield for any and all posts in these groups. "It's free speech," they argue. This fundamentally misrepresents what the First Amendment protects.</p>

<h3>What the First Amendment Actually Protects</h3>

<p>The First Amendment prohibits <strong>the government</strong> from restricting speech. It does not prevent private parties from facing civil liability for harmful speech. Even within its scope, the First Amendment recognizes well-established categories of unprotected speech:</p>

<strong>Protected AWDTSG speech (generally):</strong>
<li>Truthful statements about dating experiences: "We went on three dates and I wasn't interested anymore"</li>
<li>Genuine personal opinions: "I didn't feel a connection" or "He wasn't my type"</li>
<li>Subjective assessments that can't be proven true or false: "Bad vibes" or "Worst date ever"</li>

<strong>Unprotected speech that appears constantly in AWDTSG posts:</strong>
<li><strong>Defamation</strong> — False statements of fact that damage reputation</li>
<li><strong>Invasion of privacy</strong> — Sharing private information without consent</li>
<li><strong>True threats and harassment</strong> — Content that creates a reasonable fear of harm</li>
<li><strong>Doxing</strong> — Publishing personal identifying information to facilitate harassment</li>

<p>The First Amendment is not, and has never been, a license to publish false and damaging information about private individuals. Courts have consistently held that false statements of fact receive no First Amendment protection because they contribute nothing to public discourse while causing substantial harm to individuals.</p>

<h3>The "Public Concern" Argument</h3>

<p>Some AWDTSG supporters argue that dating warnings serve the public interest and therefore deserve heightened First Amendment protection. Courts have been skeptical of this argument for several reasons:</p>

<li><strong>Private dating behavior is not a matter of public concern.</strong> Unlike speech about government officials or public policy, posts about private individuals' dating lives don't implicate the core values the First Amendment was designed to protect.</li>

<li><strong>False factual claims are never protected.</strong> Even speech about matters of public concern loses protection when it contains provably false statements of fact. A false claim that someone committed domestic violence isn't transformed into protected speech because it appears in a group nominally concerned with "safety."</li>

<li><strong>Private figures have stronger protections.</strong> The vast majority of men posted in AWDTSG are private individuals, not public figures. Private figures need only prove negligence — not actual malice — to win defamation claims.</li>

<h2>Don't Wait — Your Privacy Rights Matter</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every day the post stays up, your privacy is further compromised.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, the audience for your private information is massive. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.

<h2>When AWDTSG Posts Cross Into Defamation</h2>

<p>The line between legal speech and defamation in AWDTSG groups is crossed far more frequently than most people realize. Defamation occurs when someone publishes a false statement of fact about you that damages your reputation.</p>

<strong>Common AWDTSG statements that constitute defamation:</strong>
<li>"He gave me [STD]" — Medical claim, provably false</li>
<li>"He was arrested for [crime]" — Criminal record claim, verifiable</li>
<li>"He hit me" or "He's violent" — Criminal conduct accusation</li>
<li>"He's married" or "He has a secret family" — Factual claim about marital status</li>
<li>"He stole from me" — Criminal accusation</li>
<li>"He drugged my drink" — Serious criminal accusation</li>

<p>These are not opinions. They are factual assertions that can be proven true or false. When they're false, they're defamation — period. No amount of First Amendment rhetoric changes that legal reality.</p>

<h2>Invasion of Privacy: Four Torts That Apply to AWDTSG</h2>

<p>Beyond defamation, AWDTSG posts frequently violate privacy laws through four recognized legal theories known as invasion of privacy torts:</p>

<h3>1. Public Disclosure of Private Facts</h3>

<p>This tort applies when someone widely shares private information about you that a reasonable person would find highly offensive, and the information is not of legitimate public concern.</p>

<strong>How it applies to AWDTSG:</strong>
<li>Sharing details about your sexual performance or intimate encounters</li>
<li>Disclosing private medical information (mental health, STD status, medication)</li>
<li>Revealing financial details obtained through a personal relationship</li>
<li>Publishing information from private conversations or messages</li>
<li>Sharing details about family situations (custody arrangements, divorces)</li>

<p>The key element is that the information was <strong>private</strong> — something you hadn't publicly shared — and its disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. The group's thousands of members easily satisfy the "wide publication" requirement.</p>

<h3>2. False Light</h3>

<p>False light claims apply when someone publicizes information that places you in a false and highly offensive light before the public. This tort is related to defamation but is broader — it covers misleading implications, not just explicit false statements.</p>

<strong>How it applies to AWDTSG:</strong>
<li>Posting your photo with misleading context that implies you're dangerous</li>
<li>Selectively editing screenshots of conversations to create a false narrative</li>
<li>Juxtaposing your photo with other men accused of criminal behavior, creating a false association</li>
<li>Sharing a partial truth that creates a misleading overall impression</li>
<li>Using your photo in a "warning" post when you've done nothing wrong</li>

<p>False light claims are particularly relevant to AWDTSG because many posts rely on implication and innuendo rather than explicit false statements. The overall impression created by the post may be far more damaging than any single statement it contains.</p>

<h3>3. Intrusion Upon Seclusion</h3>

<p>This tort applies when someone intentionally intrudes upon your private affairs in a manner that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.</p>

<strong>How it applies to AWDTSG:</strong>
<li>Screenshotting and sharing private dating app messages without consent</li>
<li>Using fake profiles to obtain private information for the purpose of posting it</li>
<li>Accessing your private social media accounts to gather material</li>
<li>Contacting your friends, family, or employer to gather information for an AWDTSG post</li>
<li>Monitoring your activities or following you to obtain information to post</li>

<p>Intrusion upon seclusion focuses on <strong>how the information was obtained</strong>, not just what was published. Even truthful information may give rise to a claim if it was obtained through intrusive means.</p>

<h3>4. Appropriation of Name or Likeness</h3>

<p>This tort applies when someone uses your name or image for their own purposes without consent.</p>

<strong>How it applies to AWDTSG:</strong>
<li>Using your dating app photos in a public "warning" post without permission</li>
<li>Sharing your professional headshot alongside false accusations</li>
<li>Using your photo to generate engagement, likes, and comments in the group</li>
<li>Reposting your image across multiple groups and platforms</li>

<p>While appropriation claims are traditionally associated with commercial use, courts have expanded the tort to cover situations where someone's identity is used to serve the poster's purpose of social media engagement and attention.</p>

<h2>State-Specific Laws: The D'Ambrosio Case and Beyond</h2>

<p>One of the most significant legal developments for AWDTSG cases has been the application of state-specific statutes that go beyond traditional defamation and privacy torts.</p>

<h3>The Illinois Anti-Doxing Act (D'Ambrosio Case)</h3>

<p>In a case that garnered national attention, an Illinois man named D'Ambrosio successfully pursued legal action against an AWDTSG poster using the <strong>Illinois Anti-Doxing Act</strong>. This statute prohibits publishing personally identifiable information about another person when the publication is intended to harass, threaten, or intimidate.</p>

<p>The significance of this case extends far beyond Illinois:</p>

<li><strong>It demonstrated that existing anti-doxing statutes apply to AWDTSG posts.</strong> The posting of names, photos, workplaces, and other identifying information in an AWDTSG group can constitute doxing under state law.</li>
<li><strong>It created a precedent for statutory damages.</strong> Anti-doxing statutes often provide for specific monetary penalties, making recovery more predictable than traditional defamation claims.</li>
<li><strong>It bypassed some Section 230 complications.</strong> Because anti-doxing statutes create their own framework of liability, they can provide a path to relief that doesn't rely on traditional defamation analysis.</li>

<h3>Other State Laws That Apply</h3>

<p>Multiple states have laws that can be leveraged against AWDTSG posters:</p>

<strong>Cyberbullying and cyber harassment statutes.</strong> Over 40 states have laws addressing online harassment — a widespread problem that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a> found affects 41% of Americans. AWDTSG posts that constitute a pattern of harassment, especially when the poster makes multiple posts or encourages others to contact the subject, may violate these statutes.

<strong>Revenge porn and intimate image laws.</strong> If an AWDTSG post includes intimate images shared in confidence, over 45 states now have laws specifically addressing non-consensual sharing of intimate images. These laws often carry criminal penalties in addition to civil liability.

<strong>Enhanced stalking and harassment provisions.</strong> Many states have updated stalking laws to include electronic and social media-based conduct. Repeated AWDTSG posting about the same individual may qualify as stalking behavior under these provisions.

<strong>Consumer protection and unfair practices.</strong> Some states' consumer protection laws can apply when AWDTSG posts damage someone's business or professional reputation through false statements.

<h2>Section 230: What It Does and Doesn't Protect</h2>

<p>No discussion of AWDTSG legality is complete without addressing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is perhaps the most misunderstood law in internet jurisprudence.</p>

<h3>What Section 230 Protects</h3>

<strong>Facebook (Meta) as a platform.</strong> Section 230 shields Facebook from liability for content posted by AWDTSG group members. This is why <a href="/blog/awdtsg-complete-guide-for-men">Facebook's reporting system is largely ineffective</a> — Facebook has no legal obligation to remove defamatory content from groups.

<h3>What Section 230 Does NOT Protect</h3>

<strong>Individual posters.</strong> The person who writes and publishes a defamatory or privacy-violating AWDTSG post has <strong>zero</strong> Section 230 protection. They are the content creator, not a platform, and they bear full legal responsibility for what they publish.

<strong>Active group admins.</strong> As discussed in our <a href="/blog/awdtsg-admin-moderator-liability-guide">admin liability guide</a>, admins who actively curate, approve, and maintain defamatory content may lose Section 230 protection.

<strong>Criminal conduct.</strong> Section 230 does not provide immunity for federal criminal statutes, and many state laws (like anti-doxing and cyber harassment statutes) create their own liability frameworks.

<h2>Legal vs. Actionable: Understanding the Distinction</h2>

<p>This distinction is crucial for anyone trying to understand the legality of AWDTSG:</p>

<h3>Legal and Non-Actionable (You Cannot Sue)</h3>
<li>Truthful account of a dating experience using only opinions</li>
<li>Asking if others have dated someone without making accusations</li>
<li>Sharing subjective feelings: "I felt uncomfortable" or "I wasn't interested"</li>

<h3>Legal but Potentially Actionable (Gray Area)</h3>
<li>Truthful statements that disclose private information (may violate privacy torts)</li>
<li>Using someone's photo from a dating app in a post (potential appropriation claim)</li>
<li>Sharing private messages without context (potential false light claim)</li>

<h3>Illegal and Actionable (Strong Legal Claims)</h3>
<li>False statements of fact: "He has herpes," "He was arrested," "He's a predator"</li>
<li>Doxing: Publishing full name, workplace, address with intent to harass</li>
<li>Sharing intimate images without consent</li>
<li>Repeated targeted posts constituting harassment or stalking</li>
<li>Posts that facilitate real-world threats or intimidation</li>

<p>Most AWDTSG posts that cause serious harm fall into the third category. They don't contain mere opinions about bad dates — they contain provably false accusations of criminal conduct, sexually transmitted diseases, violence, or other damaging claims that courts have consistently held to be actionable.</p>

<h2>What the Law Says About AWDTSG in 2026</h2>

<p>The legal landscape around AWDTSG groups is evolving in a direction that increasingly protects the subjects of posts:</p>

<strong>Courts are applying traditional defamation law.</strong> AWDTSG posts are not some novel legal category. They are published statements, and defamation law applies to them just as it applies to any other publication. Courts are granting judgments against posters.

<strong>Privacy torts are gaining traction.</strong> As more cases are litigated, courts are recognizing that AWDTSG posts frequently violate multiple privacy rights simultaneously. The combination of defamation and privacy claims gives plaintiffs multiple paths to relief.

<strong>State legislatures are paying attention.</strong> The growing awareness of AWDTSG harm is driving legislative action on anti-doxing, cyber harassment, and online defamation. New protections are being enacted regularly.

<strong>International rulings create momentum.</strong> Cases like <a href="/blog/awdtsg-admin-moderator-liability-guide">Belliveau v Quinlan</a> in Canada demonstrate that courts worldwide are holding AWDTSG participants accountable.

<h2>Protecting Your Rights</h2>

<p>If your privacy has been violated by an AWDTSG post, you have more legal options than you might think. But legal action is slow and expensive. The most effective immediate step is professional removal.</p>

<li><strong>Preserve evidence.</strong> Screenshot the post, comments, shares, and the poster's profile. This evidence is critical for both removal and potential legal claims.</li>

<li><strong>Don't engage with the group.</strong> Anything you post or message can be used against you. Do not contact the poster or the admin directly. For guidance, see our <a href="/blog/posted-in-awdtsg-what-to-do">what to do when you're posted</a> guide.</li>

<li><strong>Contact a professional removal service.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Tea App Green Flags</a> achieves post removal within 30 to 90 days with a 92-95% success rate. We work through multiple removal pathways simultaneously while preserving your legal options.</li>

<li><strong>Consult with an attorney.</strong> If you want to pursue damages, a defamation or privacy attorney can evaluate your specific post against the legal theories discussed in this article. Many offer free initial consultations.</li>

<li><strong>Act quickly.</strong> The longer the post remains published, the more your privacy is compromised, the more people see it, and the more it spreads across platforms. Speed is your most important advantage.</li>

<p>The question isn't really whether AWDTSG is legal. The question is whether the specific post about you crossed the lines that the law has clearly drawn. In most cases involving false factual accusations, private information disclosure, or doxing, the answer is yes — and you have real options for fighting back.</p>
