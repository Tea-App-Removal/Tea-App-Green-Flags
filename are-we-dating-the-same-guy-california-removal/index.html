        <p>California is ground zero for the AWDTSG phenomenon. With some of the largest dating populations in the country and a culture that lives online, California's "Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups have exploded in membership. The Los Angeles group alone has over 79,000 members. San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento each have their own massive groups. If you've been posted in a California AWDTSG group, your name is potentially visible to tens of thousands of women across the state right now. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent.</p>

<p>The good news: California has some of the strongest privacy and defamation protections in the nation. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment. Professional removal services leverage these laws to achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates for California AWDTSG posts.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across California</h2>

<p>California's size and population mean the state has more AWDTSG groups than almost any other state. These groups are massive, active, and deeply embedded in California's dating culture.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Los Angeles</strong> — Over 79,000 members covering LA County, the Westside, Hollywood, the Valley, Long Beach, Pasadena, and surrounding areas</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco</strong> — Over 27,000 members covering the Bay Area including Oakland, San Jose, Berkeley, and the broader Silicon Valley region</li>
<li><strong>San Diego</strong> — Over 22,000 members covering San Diego County including La Jolla, North County, and the military communities near multiple bases</li>
<li><strong>Sacramento</strong> — Over 12,000 members covering the state capital and surrounding areas including Roseville, Folsom, and Elk Grove</li>
<li><strong>Orange County</strong> — Active group covering Irvine, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Anaheim, and surrounding cities</li>
<li><strong>Inland Empire</strong> — Covering Riverside, San Bernardino, and the rapidly growing IE region</li>
<li><strong>Fresno/Central Valley</strong> — Serving Fresno, Bakersfield, Stockton, and Modesto communities</li>
<li><strong>Santa Barbara</strong> — Covering the Central Coast including Ventura and San Luis Obispo</li>
<li><strong>Palm Springs/Coachella Valley</strong> — Active seasonal group with spikes during festival season</li>

<p>The sheer scale of California's AWDTSG groups creates compounding problems. A post in the LA group can reach 79,000+ women. Screenshots from LA get shared to San Francisco, San Diego, and Orange County groups. Cross-group sharing means a single false accusation can be visible to well over 150,000 women across California within days.</p>

<p>California's entertainment industry adds another layer of risk. Posts about men working in Hollywood, tech, or other high-profile California industries can jump from AWDTSG groups to gossip accounts, Reddit threads, and industry social media circles with devastating professional consequences.

<h2>Protect Your California Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ California has 25 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 39.0M population.

<h2>California Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>California provides exceptional legal protections against defamation and privacy violations, making it one of the best states for pursuing AWDTSG post removal.</p>

<strong>California Civil Code § 44 through § 48</strong> governs defamation in California. The state recognizes libel (Cal. Civ. Code § 45) as a false and unprivileged publication that exposes someone to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or injures their reputation. AWDTSG Facebook posts clearly fall within this definition.

<strong>California Civil Code § 45a</strong> defines <strong>libel per se</strong> — statements that are defamatory on their face without the need for extrinsic evidence. Most AWDTSG posts accusing men of cheating, abuse, criminal behavior, or disease qualify as libel per se, meaning damages are presumed.

<p>California's statute of limitations for defamation is <strong>one year</strong> under <strong><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=45.&lawCode=CIV">California Code of Civil Procedure § 340(c)</strong>. This shor</a>ter timeline makes prompt action essential. However, the single publication rule has been modified by California courts to recognize that each new posting or sharing can constitute a new publication.</p>

<p>What makes California truly powerful for AWDTSG removal is the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong> and the <strong>California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)</strong>. These landmark privacy laws give California residents the right to request deletion of personal information collected and shared without consent. AWDTSG posts that share names, photos, personal details, and location information may trigger CCPA/CPRA protections.</p>

<strong>California's Right of Publicity (Cal. Civ. Code § 3344)</strong> protects against the unauthorized use of your name and likeness, adding yet another legal tool for removal.

<strong>California Penal Code § 653.2</strong> — California's cyber-exploitation and harassment statute — applies when AWDTSG posts are used as weapons for harassment or intimidation. California also has robust <strong>anti-revenge porn laws (Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85)</strong> that apply if intimate images are shared in AWDTSG groups.

<p>California's <strong>Anti-SLAPP statute (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16)</strong> is worth noting. While it protects speech on matters of public concern, California courts have repeatedly held that false statements of fact about private individuals do not qualify for Anti-SLAPP protection, particularly in defamation per se cases.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in California</h2>

<p>Our California removal process leverages the state's uniquely powerful combination of defamation law, privacy statutes, and right of publicity protections.</p>

<strong>Multi-Group Mapping.</strong> We identify the defamatory post across every California AWDTSG group where it appears or has been shared. With groups in LA, SF, San Diego, Sacramento, and many more, cross-posting is extremely common.

<strong>California Legal Arsenal.</strong> Our legal demands cite Cal. Civ. Code § 45 (libel), CCPA/CPRA privacy rights, and Cal. Civ. Code § 3344 (right of publicity). This multi-statute approach creates significantly more legal pressure than defamation claims alone.

<strong>Platform Legal Engagement.</strong> Facebook takes California legal demands seriously, particularly those citing CCPA/CPRA. As a California-headquartered company, Meta is especially responsive to California privacy law compliance demands.

<strong>Entertainment and Tech Industry Protocols.</strong> For clients in California's entertainment, tech, or other high-profile industries, we provide enhanced discretion and address industry-specific reputation channels where AWDTSG content may spread.

<strong>Statewide Cleanup.</strong> We coordinate removal across all California groups, address cross-platform spreading, submit Google deindexing requests, and monitor for reposting across the state's extensive AWDTSG network. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<p>Most California removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> with a ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rate.</p>

<h2>California Moves Fast — So Should You</h2>

<p>California law gives you powerful tools for removal. Professional services know how to use every one of them. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get emergency AWDTSG removal in California now</a>.</p>



<h2>California Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Cal. Civ. Code § 44-48, California provides a 1 year statute of limitations for defamation claims. California recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. California courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in CA county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Cal. Civ. Code § 44-48 and applicable California case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
