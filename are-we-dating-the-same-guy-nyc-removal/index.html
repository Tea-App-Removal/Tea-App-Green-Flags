    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How many members are in the NYC AWDTSG group?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The New York City &quot;Are We Dating The Same Guy&quot; Facebook group has over 164,000 members, making it the largest AWDTSG group in the United States. The group is restricted to women only, meaning men cannot view posts or request removal on their own."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue someone for posting about me in the NYC AWDTSG group?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Under [New York defamation law](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CVR/76), false statements of fact published in Facebook groups are actionable. New York recognizes defamation per se for accusations involving criminal conduct, sexual misconduct, or professional incompetence, meaning you don't need to prove specific financial damages. The statute of limitations is one year from the date of publication."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to remove an AWDTSG post in New York City?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Professional removal services typically complete New York City AWDTSG post removals within 30 to 90 days. However, early action is critical — the longer a post remains active in a group with 164,000+ members, the more screenshots and cross-platform spread occur, which extends the scope of work required."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will Facebook remove my AWDTSG post if I report it myself?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In the vast majority of cases, no. Facebook's standard reporting system rarely removes posts from AWDTSG groups because automated review doesn't flag them as policy violations. Professional removal services use legal channels and formal documentation that bypass the standard reporting process, achieving 92-95% success rates."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do AWDTSG posts show up on Google searches for my name?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"They can. While Facebook group posts are typically not directly indexed, screenshots shared on Reddit, blogs, or public social media profiles can appear in Google search results. Professional removal services address cross-platform spread and work with search engines to deindex any content associated with your name."}}]}

        <p>You found out an hour ago. Maybe a friend texted you a screenshot. Maybe your sister called. Someone posted your name and photo in the New York City "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group, and the comments are already piling up. Hundreds of women across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens are reading accusations about you right now — and none of it is true. This is the moment when every minute counts.</p>

<p>The New York City AWDTSG group is the largest in the country. With a dating pool of millions and a social media culture that thrives on virality, a single post in this group can obliterate your reputation before sunrise. You need professional removal, and you need it fast.</p>

<h2>The New York City AWDTSG Group: The Biggest in America</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy NYC" Facebook group has over <strong>164,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, cannot comment, and cannot request removal directly. You can find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/340985311306448/">facebook.com/groups/340985311306448/</a>, but you won't be able to see what's been said about you.</p>

<p>This group has 164,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>That's the core problem. In New York City, where dating apps like Hinge, Bumble, and Raya dominate the scene from the Upper East Side to Williamsburg, a single AWDTSG post reaches an audience larger than many small cities. Posts routinely receive hundreds of comments within hours. Screenshots get shared across Instagram Stories, group chats, and Reddit threads covering the NYC dating scene.</p>

<p>New York City's density makes this especially dangerous. Your coworkers, neighbors, clients, and professional contacts are all within the blast radius. A post accusing you of cheating, manipulation, or worse doesn't just affect your dating life in New York City — it can reach your employer, your landlord, and your professional network across all five boroughs.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the New York City AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 164,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How AWDTSG Posts Spread in New York City</h2>

<p>New York City's dating scene is hyperconnected. Women dating in Manhattan often have friends in Brooklyn, work contacts in Midtown, and social circles stretching from Astoria to Park Slope. When someone posts in the NYC AWDTSG group, the information doesn't stay contained.</p>

<p>Here's how the damage typically spreads across New York City:</p>

<li><strong>Screenshots hit Instagram Stories</strong> within the first hour, often with your name and photo visible</li>
<li><strong>Group chats</strong> among friend groups across the city share the post with commentary</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to other groups</strong> — the Long Island, Westchester, and New Jersey AWDTSG groups all overlap with NYC's dating pool</li>
<li><strong>Reddit threads</strong> on r/NYCDating and r/hingeapp pick up the discussion</li>
<li><strong>Google indexing</strong> begins within days, meaning searches for your name start returning results tied to the accusations</li>

<p>The speed of spread in New York City is unmatched. A post made at 10 PM can reach ten thousand women by morning. By the time you realize what happened, the damage has already cascaded across platforms that extend far beyond Facebook.</p>

<p>Dating apps popular in New York City — Hinge, Bumble, Raya, The League — create an interconnected web where a single accusation follows you from app to app. Women screenshot AWDTSG posts and share them directly in dating app conversations. Your matches in SoHo are seeing the same accusations as women in the Financial District and Harlem.</p>

<h2>New York Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>New York State provides strong legal protections against defamation. Under New York Civil Rights Law and common law defamation standards, you have the right to pursue action against anyone who publishes false statements of fact that damage your reputation.</p>

<p>Key points about New York defamation law:</p>

<li><strong>No requirement to prove special damages</strong> for defamation per se — false accusations of criminal behavior, sexual misconduct, or professional incompetence are actionable without proving specific financial losses</li>
<li><strong>Statute of limitations</strong> is one year from publication in New York</li>
<li><strong>New York courts</strong> have consistently recognized that online posts, including social media group posts, constitute "publication" for defamation purposes</li>
<li><strong>Section 230</strong> does not protect the individual poster — only the platform. The person who wrote the AWDTSG post about you in New York City can be held personally liable</li>

<p>These legal protections give <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> significant leverage when working on behalf of New York City clients. Legal documentation citing New York defamation statutes carries weight with Facebook's legal team and often accelerates the removal process.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for New York City AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Standard Facebook reporting almost never works for AWDTSG posts. Facebook's automated systems don't flag these posts as violations, and group admins in the New York City group typically reject removal requests, claiming they're protecting women's safety. DIY approaches — messaging the poster, commenting through a friend, or trying to report the post yourself — almost always backfire and generate additional posts.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> take a different approach. Here's what the process looks like for New York City clients:

<strong>Step 1: Documentation and Assessment</strong> — We identify every instance of the post across the NYC AWDTSG group, related groups (Long Island, Westchester, NJ), and any cross-platform spread to Instagram, Reddit, or Google search results.

<strong>Step 2: Legal Notice Preparation</strong> — Using New York defamation law, we prepare formal legal documentation that goes through Facebook's legal channels — not the standard reporting system that ignores your requests.

<strong>Step 3: Multi-Platform Removal</strong> — We address the original post, all screenshots and reposts, and work with search engines to deindex any cached content tied to your name.

<strong>Step 4: Monitoring</strong> — After removal, we monitor for reposting attempts across the New York City AWDTSG group and related groups.

<p>Our typical timeline for New York City removals is <strong>30 to 90 days</strong>, with a success rate of <strong>92-95%</strong>. Given the size of the NYC group, early action dramatically reduces the total scope of damage.</p>

<p>If content has also appeared on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App or similar platforms</a>, we handle those removals simultaneously as part of a comprehensive approach.</p>

<h2>Don't Wait — Every Hour Matters in New York City</h2>

<p>New York City moves fast. The AWDTSG group with 164,000+ members means your post is being seen by hundreds of women every hour it stays up. The longer you wait, the more screenshots get captured, the more cross-platform spread occurs, and the harder comprehensive removal becomes.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the New York City "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group, take these steps immediately:</p>

<li><strong>Document everything</strong> — Have a trusted friend screenshot the post and all comments before anything is edited or deleted</li>
<li><strong>Do not contact the poster directly</strong> — This almost always makes things worse in NYC AWDTSG groups</li>
<li><strong>Do not have someone post on your behalf</strong> — This triggers a pile-on effect</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services immediately</a></strong> — The sooner removal begins, the less damage accumulates</li>

<p>Your reputation in New York City matters. False accusations in the nation's largest AWDTSG group can be removed. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get started with professional removal today</a>.</p>
