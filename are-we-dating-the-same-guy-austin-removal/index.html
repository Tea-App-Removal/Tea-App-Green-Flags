        <p>Austin prides itself on being weird, connected, and community-driven. That same tight-knit social fabric makes the Austin "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group one of the most damaging AWDTSG groups in Texas. When someone posts false accusations about you in a group with twenty thousand members in a city where everyone seems to know everyone, the consequences hit fast and they hit hard. Your reputation on Rainey Street, South Congress, East Austin, and the entire Austin dating scene can collapse overnight.</p>

<p>If you just discovered you've been posted in the Austin AWDTSG group, you're probably panicking. That's a rational response. But what you do next matters more than what's already been posted. Austin AWDTSG removal requires a professional, strategic approach — not an emotional reaction.</p>

<h2>The Austin AWDTSG Group: What You're Up Against</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Austin" Facebook group has over <strong>20,000 members</strong> and is one of the largest AWDTSG groups in Texas alongside Dallas and Houston. The group is restricted to women only — men cannot view posts, see comments, or request removal directly. You can find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/324538653155758/">facebook.com/groups/324538653155758/</a>. All posts are subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 20,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Austin's population boom over the past decade means the group grows constantly. Tech workers relocating from California and the Northeast, University of Texas students and alumni, and Austin's thriving creative community all contribute to a massive and highly active membership base. The Austin AWDTSG group sees multiple new posts daily, with peak activity on weekend evenings after nights out on Sixth Street, Rainey Street, and East Austin.</p>

<p>The tech-savvy Austin demographic means posts get screenshotted, archived, and shared more efficiently than in many other cities. Austin's AWDTSG group members are digitally fluent and connected across every platform.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Austin AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 28,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Austin</h2>

<p>Austin is a city of overlapping social circles. The tech scene, the music scene, the UT campus, the startup community — they all intersect constantly. A post in the Austin AWDTSG group doesn't stay in one corner of the city's social landscape. It penetrates every Austin social circle through interconnected networks.</p>

<p>The Austin spread pattern typically looks like this:</p>

<li><strong>Sixth Street and Rainey Street social circles</strong> — Austin's nightlife communities are tightly connected. Posts about men in these scenes reach bartenders, promoters, and regulars within hours.</li>
<li><strong>Tech industry networks</strong> — Austin's booming tech sector means AWDTSG posts reach professional circles at companies like Tesla, Meta, Google, Oracle, and hundreds of Austin startups.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Texas AWDTSG groups</strong> — Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio groups frequently share Austin posts, especially when someone is described as traveling between Texas cities.</li>
<li><strong>University of Texas networks</strong> — UT Austin's massive student body and alumni network amplifies posts to younger demographics across the Austin dating scene.</li>

<p>The convergence of Austin's social, professional, and nightlife networks means a single AWDTSG post can damage your reputation across every facet of life in Austin simultaneously.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> move quickly to contain Austin AWDTSG posts before they cross from social circles into professional networks.

<h2>Texas Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Texas provides strong legal protections against defamation under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 73. For Austin residents facing false AWDTSG posts, these protections create meaningful leverage for removal.</p>

<a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CP/htm/CP.73.htm">Under Texas law</a>, defamation requires proving a false statement of fact was published to a third party with at least <strong>negligence</strong> regarding the statement's truth or falsity. Texas recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for statements that accuse someone of a crime, impute a loathsome disease, injure someone in their profession, or accuse someone of sexual misconduct. Most false AWDTSG posts in Austin fall squarely into these categories.

<p>Texas also has a <strong>one-year statute of limitations</strong> for defamation claims, so acting quickly on Austin AWDTSG posts is critical. Additionally, Texas courts have awarded significant damages in online defamation cases, which strengthens the legal leverage our removal notices carry.</p>

<p>One important note: Texas has an <strong>anti-SLAPP statute</strong> (Texas Citizens Participation Act) that protects free speech on matters of public concern. However, false accusations of personal misconduct in AWDTSG groups generally don't qualify for anti-SLAPP protection. Professional removal services understand these nuances and craft legal documentation that accounts for Texas-specific procedural rules.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Austin AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/263149623790594">Facebook's standard reporting process</a> consistently fails for Austin AWDTSG posts. Group admins reject requests, and Facebook's automated review system doesn't recognize these posts as violations. Meanwhile, damage compounds daily across Austin's interconnected social networks.

<p>Professional Austin AWDTSG removal includes:</p>

<strong>Legally grounded cease-and-desist notices.</strong> Our legal documentation cites Texas defamation statutes and identifies specific false statements, routing removal requests through Facebook's legal compliance channels rather than standard reporting queues.

<strong>Full Austin ecosystem cleanup.</strong> We remove the original post plus every screenshot and share across Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, dating apps, and other platforms where Austin AWDTSG content has spread.

<strong>Google search result management.</strong> If searching your name returns Austin AWDTSG content, we work to deindex those results and suppress them in search rankings.

<strong>Proactive monitoring.</strong> Austin's social circles are tight enough that reposting happens. We monitor for your name across all platforms and act immediately if content resurfaces.

<p>Our Austin AWDTSG removal services achieve a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong> with an average completion time of <strong>30 to 90 days</strong>. For Austin tech professionals and public-facing individuals where reputation damage escalates quickly, expedited options are available.</p>

<p>For multi-platform defamation affecting your dating profiles and app reputation, our <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App defamation removal service</a> provides comprehensive removal across dating-specific platforms.</p>

<h2>The Austin AWDTSG Post Is Not Going Away on Its Own</h2>

<p>Some men hope that Austin AWDTSG posts will eventually get buried by newer content. They won't. In a group with 20,000 active members, posts get resurfaced when someone searches a name before a date. Screenshots live in camera rolls and group chats indefinitely. Google caches the content. The Austin post becomes a permanent fixture of your digital identity unless it's professionally removed.</p>

<p>The cost of waiting always exceeds the cost of acting. Every day that defamatory Austin AWDTSG content remains visible means more women see it, more screenshots circulate, and more damage accumulates. Professional Austin AWDTSG removal is an investment in protecting every aspect of your life in Austin — personal, professional, and social.</p>
