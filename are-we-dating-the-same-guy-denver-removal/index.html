        <p>You just got a call from a friend you haven't heard from in months. "Hey man, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're in one of those dating groups on Facebook." Your photo and name are in the Denver "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group with a wall of false accusations beneath them. Women in LoDo, Capitol Hill, and the Highlands are reading it. In Denver's tight-knit, outdoor-loving social scene where everyone seems to know each other from a hiking group, a brewery, or a dating app, this post is about to change how the city sees you.</p>

<p>Denver's growing population of young professionals has created a dating scene that's active, social, and increasingly reliant on AWDTSG groups for screening. A false post here doesn't just hurt your dating life — it follows you to every taproom, trailhead, and networking event in the city.</p>

<h2>The Denver AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Denver" Facebook group has over <strong>24,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, comment, or request removal. The group is at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/1010295464364004/">facebook.com/groups/1010295464364004/</a>. All content is subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a> and their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 24,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Denver's AWDTSG group captures the entire Front Range dating market. Women in Denver proper, Aurora, Lakewood, Boulder, and the surrounding suburbs all participate. The city's booming population of transplants — drawn by tech jobs, outdoor recreation, and quality of life — has created a dating scene that relies heavily on apps like Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder. AWDTSG has become the go-to vetting tool in Denver before a first date.</p>

<p>The Denver group is particularly active because the city's social culture revolves around shared activities — hiking, skiing, brewery hopping — that create dense social networks. Women in the group often know each other through these activity-based communities, which means posts get personal fast.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Denver AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 25,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Denver</h2>

<p>Denver's social scene is built on shared experiences and overlapping communities. The same people you see at a brewery in RiNo might be in your hiking group and your friend's yoga class. This creates a social web where information travels through activity-based connections, not just geographic ones.</p>

<p>How AWDTSG posts spread in Denver:</p>

<li><strong>Activity-based group chats</strong> — Hiking groups, ski groups, run clubs, and brewery friend groups share screenshots through their existing communication channels</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> hit Denver's active outdoor-lifestyle social media community quickly</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to Boulder and Colorado Springs groups</strong> — The Front Range dating market is highly interconnected</li>
<li><strong>Bumble BFF and social app networks</strong> — Denver's transplant-heavy population uses social apps to build friend groups, creating additional sharing channels</li>
<li><strong>Workplace gossip in tech and cannabis industries</strong> — Denver's concentrated industry sectors create professional communities where dating gossip crosses into business reputation</li>

<p>Denver's "small-town feel" in a big city is a double-edged sword. The community connections that make Denver appealing also make a false AWDTSG post devastating. Your reputation at the climbing gym, the dog park, and the co-working space are all connected in Denver.</p>

<h2>Colorado Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Colorado provides clear legal protections against defamation under C.R.S. § 13-21-102 and common law principles.</p>

<p>Key aspects of Colorado defamation law for Denver residents:</p>

<li><strong>Defamation per se</strong> in Colorado covers false statements imputing criminal conduct, a loathsome disease, sexual misconduct, or harm to business, trade, or profession — no special damages required</li>
<li><strong>Colorado's statute of limitations</strong> for defamation is one year from publication</li>
<li><strong>Colorado's anti-SLAPP provisions</strong> exist but are narrower than some states and do not protect provably false statements of fact</li>
<li><strong>Actual and presumed damages</strong> are available in per se cases</li>
<li><strong>Colorado courts</strong> have recognized online publication as meeting defamation requirements</li>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal services</a> leverage Colorado defamation law when pursuing removal through Facebook's legal compliance channels for Denver clients.

<h2>Professional Removal for Denver AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Facebook's reporting system doesn't work for Denver AWDTSG posts. Group admins reject requests, automated systems ignore them, and direct contact with the poster makes the situation worse. In Denver's active social scene, a botched DIY removal attempt becomes its own social media event.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal</a> handles Denver cases through a structured process:

<strong>Front Range Assessment</strong> — We identify every instance of the post across the Denver AWDTSG group, Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins groups, Instagram shares, Reddit threads, and Google search results.

<strong>Colorado Legal Documentation</strong> — We prepare formal notices under Colorado defamation law for submission through Facebook's legal compliance channels, bypassing standard reporting.

<strong>Multi-Platform Cleanup</strong> — We address the original post, all cross-platform spread, and search engine indexing across every platform where your name appears alongside the accusations.

<strong>Ongoing Monitoring</strong> — After removal, we watch the Denver AWDTSG group and Front Range groups for reposting attempts.

<p>Denver removals typically complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong>. In a city where social circles overlap through activities, work, and neighborhoods, rapid professional action is the key to preventing deep reputation damage.</p>

<p>For content on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App or other platforms</a>, we handle all removals as part of a comprehensive strategy.</p>

<h2>Denver's Social Scene Doesn't Forget — Act Now</h2>

<p>With 24,000+ members and a social culture that connects everyone through outdoor activities, shared interests, and a growing tech scene, the Denver AWDTSG group can reshape how your entire social world sees you. Every day the post stays live, it reaches deeper into the interconnected communities that make Denver feel like a small town.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Denver "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group:</p>

<li><strong>Have someone you trust screenshot everything</strong> — The post, comments, and poster's profile before anything changes</li>
<li><strong>Don't reach out to the poster</strong> — Denver's social world is too interconnected for this not to backfire</li>
<li><strong>Consider your activity-based social exposure</strong> — If you're active in hiking groups, run clubs, or brewery scenes, the post will likely reach those communities</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services now</a></strong> — The sooner you act, the fewer Denver communities the post reaches</li>

<p>Denver is a city worth protecting your reputation in. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start professional AWDTSG removal today</a>.</p>
