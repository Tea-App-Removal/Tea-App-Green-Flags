    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How fast can a Cleveland AWDTSG post be removed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most Cleveland AWDTSG removals are completed within 30 to 90 days. We begin the legal documentation and submission process immediately, and many posts come down even sooner. Cases with extensive cross-platform spread to other Ohio groups may take slightly longer to fully clean up."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will trying to defend myself in the Cleveland AWDTSG group help?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Responding directly in the group — whether through a friend, a fake account, or any other method — almost always backfires. It generates more comments, additional posts, and accusations that you're &quot;proving their point.&quot; Professional third-party removal through legal channels is the only approach that consistently works."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you remove my post from multiple Ohio AWDTSG groups?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Posts from Cleveland's group frequently spread to Columbus, Cincinnati, Akron, and broader Ohio AWDTSG groups. Our service tracks all instances across every Ohio group and addresses them simultaneously through the same legal removal process."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if I don't know exactly what was posted about me in Cleveland?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many clients learn about AWDTSG posts secondhand through friends or dating matches. We can locate and document the post independently — you don't need screenshots to start the removal process. The sooner you engage our services, the sooner we can identify the full scope and begin removal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Ohio law support removing false AWDTSG posts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Ohio's defamation laws and recognition of defamation per se provide strong legal grounds for removal. Our documentation cites Ohio-specific statutes that create real leverage through Facebook's legal review process. Get a free assessment of your Cleveland case."}}]}

        <p>It's late on a Tuesday night and your phone won't stop buzzing. A woman you went on two dates with months ago has posted your photo and full name in Cleveland's "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group. She claims you're dangerous, manipulative, and a serial cheater. None of it is true, but the post already has over a hundred comments from women across Cleveland agreeing they should "stay away." Cleveland AWDTSG removal just became your top priority.</p>

<p>Cleveland's dating scene runs through the same neighborhoods and social circles where your personal and professional life exist. From Ohio City breweries to Tremont restaurants to University Circle events, the overlap between dating and everyday life means a false AWDTSG post doesn't stay in a dating bubble — it infects everything.</p>

<h2>The Cleveland AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>Cleveland's "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group has over eleven thousand members spanning the entire Greater Cleveland area. This group has 11,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly. You can find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/1546294476199912/">facebook.com/groups/1546294476199912/</a>. All posts are subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The group covers Cleveland proper plus surrounding communities — Lakewood, Rocky River, Westlake, Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, and communities stretching into Akron and the surrounding suburbs. Cleveland's metro area is compact enough that most members run in overlapping social circles, making the impact of any single post disproportionately high.</p>

<p>Cleveland's group also intersects with nearby AWDTSG groups in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Akron. Women who split time between Northeast Ohio cities or recently relocated often share content across groups. A post targeting you in Cleveland can appear in three or four Ohio groups within a day.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Cleveland AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 14,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Cleveland</h2>

<p>Cleveland's dating market is a mix of young professionals in downtown and Ohio City, hospital workers from the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals corridor, and long-time residents across the West Side and East Side neighborhoods. Dating apps like Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder are popular, but Cleveland also has a strong "meeting through mutual friends" culture — which means a defamatory post reaches people in your actual social network, not just strangers.</p>

<p>The spread pattern in Cleveland typically follows this path: AWDTSG Facebook post → screenshot shared in group texts → posted to Instagram Stories → discussed at local bars and social events → indexed by Google. Cleveland's tight-knit neighborhoods like Tremont, Ohio City, Detroit Shoreway, and the Flats create natural gossip networks where digital content becomes real-world conversation fast.</p>

<p>Posts that gain traction in Cleveland's AWDTSG group often get shared to <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App</a> and Reddit's Cleveland subreddit, extending the damage beyond Facebook. Search engines pick up these cross-platform mentions, meaning anyone searching your name finds defamatory content across multiple results.</p>

<h2>Ohio Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Ohio provides robust legal protections against defamation. <a href="https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-2739.01">Under Ohio law</a>, defamation requires a false statement of fact published to a third party that causes harm to your reputation. Ohio Revised Code § 2739.01 and related case law establish clear frameworks for pursuing defamation claims.</p>

<p>Ohio recognizes defamation per se for statements that impute criminal behavior, harm someone's professional reputation, or accuse someone of a "loathsome disease." Many false accusations in Cleveland's AWDTSG group — claims of abuse, harassment, predatory behavior, or dishonesty — fall squarely within these per se categories, meaning damages are presumed without proof of specific financial losses.</p>

<p>Ohio's one-year statute of limitations for defamation claims means timing matters. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> use Ohio's specific legal framework to draft removal demands that create genuine leverage through Facebook's legal channels, often achieving faster results than any DIY approach.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Cleveland AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/263149623790594">Facebook's reporting system</a> wasn't designed to handle AWDTSG posts effectively. You click "Report," Facebook reviews it against broad community standards, and the post stays up. Meanwhile, women across Cleveland continue seeing, screenshotting, and sharing the false accusations about you.

<p>Professional removal takes a completely different route for Cleveland clients:</p>

<li><strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong> — We identify and catalog the original post, every comment, all shares, and any spread to other Ohio AWDTSG groups or platforms</li>
<li><strong>Legal drafting</strong> — Our team prepares formal removal demands citing Ohio defamation statutes, specific false claims, and Facebook's Terms of Service</li>
<li><strong>Legal channel routing</strong> — Documentation bypasses standard moderation and enters Facebook's legal review process</li>
<li><strong>Multi-platform sweep</strong> — We track and remove content from Instagram, Reddit, Tea App, and search engine caches</li>
<li><strong>Cleveland-specific monitoring</strong> — Given the cross-pollination between Ohio AWDTSG groups, we monitor Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Akron groups for reposts</li>

<p>Most Cleveland AWDTSG removals complete within 30 to 90 days with ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates. Ohio's strong defamation per se framework strengthens the legal documentation we submit to Facebook.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Cleveland Professional Reputation</h2>

<p>Cleveland's economy revolves around healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and a growing tech sector. The Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals employ tens of thousands of professionals for whom reputation directly impacts career advancement. Financial services firms in downtown Cleveland conduct thorough background and reputation checks on employees and clients.</p>

<p>A false AWDTSG post that labels you as dangerous or dishonest doesn't just affect your love life in Cleveland — it can surface during background checks, client due diligence, or professional licensing reviews. In Cleveland's professional community, where networking happens at the same events where dating happens, the overlap is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Our Cleveland removal service addresses both the immediate dating reputation crisis and the longer-term professional exposure. We ensure defamatory content is removed from every platform and deindexed from search engines, protecting your professional standing alongside your personal reputation.</p>

<p>Our Cleveland AWDTSG removal services cover the entire Cleveland metropolitan area (population 2.1M metro) including surrounding communities. The Cleveland area code (216) and ZIP codes starting with 44101 define the core service area.
