        <p>Missouri's two major metro areas create a double-barreled AWDTSG threat unlike most other states. The Kansas City group has over 13,000 members. The St. Louis group has over 11,000. Together, that's more than 24,000 women across Missouri seeing AWDTSG posts — and both groups have significant cross-border dynamics. KC straddles the Kansas line, and St. Louis bleeds into Illinois. A false post about you in Missouri reaches audiences in multiple states within hours.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in a Missouri AWDTSG group, you're facing one of the highest combined-exposure states in the Midwest. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. Professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates, and Missouri law provides strong defamation protections. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Missouri</h2>

<p>Missouri's AWDTSG landscape features two major metros plus active groups across the state.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Kansas City</strong> — Over 13,000 members covering the Missouri side including downtown, Westport, the Plaza, Lee's Summit, Independence, and Liberty, plus the Kansas side of the metro</li>
<li><strong>St. Louis</strong> — Over 11,000 members covering the city and metro area including Clayton, Kirkwood, Webster Groves, Chesterfield, the Central West End, and Soulard</li>
<li><strong>Springfield</strong> — Growing group serving the Ozarks region and the university community (MSU, Drury)</li>
<li><strong>Columbia</strong> — University of Missouri (Mizzou) community with high academic-year engagement</li>
<li><strong>Joplin</strong> — Serving the Four Corners area of southwest Missouri</li>
<li><strong>Cape Girardeau</strong> — Covering southeast Missouri and the SEMO community</li>
<li><strong>St. Joseph</strong> — Serving northwest Missouri communities</li>

<p>Kansas City's dating scene centers on Westport, the Power & Light District, the Country Club Plaza, and the Crossroads Arts District. AWDTSG posts referencing these specific social hubs are immediately recognizable to the dating community. The KC group's cross-border nature means Johnson County, Kansas residents are fully integrated into the same group.</p>

<p>St. Louis's unique neighborhood culture — the Central West End, Soulard, The Grove, Tower Grove, and downtown — drives specific, identifiable AWDTSG posts. The metro's sprawl into St. Charles County and the Illinois side (Belleville, O'Fallon IL) creates cross-state complications.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Missouri Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Missouri has 8 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 6.2M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Missouri Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Missouri provides strong defamation protections with a well-established legal framework that benefits AWDTSG victims. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong><a href="https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=509.210">Missouri Revised Statutes § 516.140</strong> sets the statute of</a> limitations for defamation at <strong>two years</strong> from publication. Missouri follows common law defamation principles recognizing both libel and slander, with AWDTSG posts constituting libel.

<p>Missouri recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their trade, business, or profession</li>
<li>Impute unchastity or serious sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, general damages are presumed without proof of specific financial loss. Most AWDTSG posts qualify under these categories.</p>

<strong>Missouri Revised Statutes § 565.090</strong> addresses harassment, including electronic harassment through social media platforms. Missouri's harassment statute is broad enough to cover targeted AWDTSG campaigns involving repeated posting or coordinated online attacks.

<strong>Mo. Rev. Stat. § 565.225 through § 565.227</strong> covers stalking, including cyberstalking through electronic communications. Persistent AWDTSG targeting of an individual may constitute stalking under Missouri law.

<p>Missouri's <strong>right of publicity statute (Mo. Rev. Stat. § 162.702)</strong> protects against unauthorized use of a person's name, voice, or likeness. AWDTSG posts sharing photos and identifying information without consent may implicate this protection.</p>

<p>Missouri courts recognize <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> claims, including false light and public disclosure of private facts. These provide additional legal tools when AWDTSG posts share private information or create misleading impressions.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Missouri</h2>

<p>Our Missouri removal process addresses the unique dual-metro dynamics and cross-border complications.</p>

<strong>Dual-Metro Strategy.</strong> We simultaneously map and address content in both the KC (13,000+) and St. Louis (11,000+) groups, plus Springfield, Columbia, and other Missouri groups. Cross-posting between Missouri's metros is common.

<strong>Cross-Border Coordination.</strong> KC spans Missouri-Kansas, and St. Louis spans Missouri-Illinois. We coordinate removal across all affected states' legal frameworks and AWDTSG groups.

<strong>Missouri Legal Documentation.</strong> Our demands cite Mo. Rev. Stat. § 516.140 limitations, applicable per se categories, and reference harassment, right of publicity, and privacy provisions for maximum legal pressure.

<strong>University Community Monitoring.</strong> Columbia (Mizzou) and Springfield (MSU) groups see academic-year spikes. We monitor for campus-specific spreading.

<strong>Complete Cleanup.</strong> Facebook removal, cross-platform tracking, Google deindexing, and ongoing monitoring across all Missouri metros. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<p>Most Missouri removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>
