    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Why did my reputation management company fail to remove content?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most reputation companies fail because they rely on suppression (pushing content down in Google) rather than actual removal, use the same standard reporting tools you could use yourself, have no relationships with platform legal compliance teams, or are outright scams. Tea App Green Flags uses direct legal removal channels with established platform relationships and achieves a 92% success rate for Tea App defamation removal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I get a refund from a reputation management company that did nothing?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Review your contract for refund provisions and submit a formal written request via certified mail. File a credit card dispute under the Fair Credit Billing Act within 60 days of the statement date. Report the company to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov, your state attorney general, and the Better Business Bureau. The FTC settled with three fraudulent reputation firms for $12.7 million in consumer refunds in 2024."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the red flags of a bad reputation management company?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Key warning signs include guaranteed results with no conditions, vague descriptions of their process (like proprietary methods), no legal component to their approach, full upfront payment with no milestones or refund terms, no verifiable track record of actual removals from specific platforms, and high-pressure sales tactics. Tea App Green Flags offers transparent processes with defined milestones and verifiable results."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What questions should I ask before hiring a reputation management service?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Ask for their specific process for removing content from the relevant platform, whether they use legal channels or standard reporting, their documented success rate with exact numbers, what happens if removal fails, whether you can speak with a previous client, and who prepares the legal documentation. Tea App Green Flags answers all of these questions with specifics during a free initial consultation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between suppression and removal for defamatory content?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Suppression pushes negative content down in Google search results by creating competing positive content, but the defamatory post still exists and can be found by anyone looking beyond page one. Removal actually eliminates the content from the platform through legal compliance channels. For serious defamation on Tea App or Facebook, Tea App Green Flags always pursues actual removal because suppression alone is insufficient."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can a second reputation company succeed where the first one failed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Tea App Green Flags maintains an above 85% success rate for previously-attempted cases. The key difference is using platform legal compliance channels rather than the standard reporting tools the first company likely relied on. However, delayed removal is harder because posts accumulate more engagement, spread to additional platforms, and gain more Google search authority over time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is Tea App Green Flags different from other reputation management companies?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Tea App Green Flags submits every removal request through platform legal compliance channels, not standard consumer reporting. We have established relationships with Tea App, Meta, and other platform compliance teams through thousands of successful removals. Our process includes legal documentation, DMCA expertise, attorney partner networks, and transparent milestones with updates at each stage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to remove content after switching to a new reputation service?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Tea App Green Flags standard process includes documentation preparation (days 1-3), platform submission (days 3-5), initial response (days 7-14), escalation if needed (days 14-21), and resolution (days 21-30 for standard cases). Emergency cases move faster with 24-48 hour timelines. A free initial assessment evaluates your current situation and determines the optimal strategy."}}]}

        <p>Anthony paid $4,200 to a reputation management company he found through a Google ad. They promised to remove a defamatory Tea App post about him within 30 days. They sent a contract with professional-looking letterhead. They assigned him a "case manager" named Jessica who responded to his emails promptly for the first week. Then the updates slowed. At the 30-day mark, the post was still live. Jessica said there had been "complications with the platform" and they needed another two weeks. At day 60, same story. At day 90, the post was still there, Anthony was out $4,200, and Jessica's email address bounced back as undeliverable. The company's website was still live, still running Google Ads, still collecting new clients.</p>

<p>Anthony is not unusual. We hear some version of his story every week. Someone discovers a defamatory post, panics, finds a reputation management company making big promises, pays them, and gets nothing. Then they find us, and we start the actual work of removal, but now they are thousands of dollars poorer, months behind, and understandably skeptical. If you hired a reputation management company that failed to deliver, this guide explains why it happened, what you should have looked for, and how to get results the second time around.</p>

<h2>Why Most Reputation Management Companies Fail at Removal</h2>

<p>The reputation management industry has a dirty secret: the majority of companies selling "removal services" cannot actually remove content from platforms. Here are the most common reasons.</p>

<strong>They rely on suppression, not removal.</strong> This is the most common failure mode. Many companies don't remove defamatory content at all. They attempt to push it down in Google search results by creating new content that ranks above it. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content. For mildly negative reviews, suppression might work. For defamatory posts on Tea App or Facebook accusing you of crimes or abuse, suppression fails because the content still exists and can be found by anyone looking beyond page one. People searching for you specifically, such as hiring managers and dates, often look beyond the first page. And the post remains shareable and screenshottable, regenerating the search visibility that suppression was supposed to address.

<strong>They use standard reporting tools instead of legal channels.</strong> The company submits reports through the same user-facing tools you could use yourself. These standard channels have success rates of roughly 10% to 15% for defamation claims because platforms' automated systems evaluate community standards violations, not truth. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment. Effective removal requires submission through each platform's legal compliance channels with documented defamation claims that get reviewed by trained compliance staff.

<strong>They have no actual relationships with platform compliance teams.</strong> Companies that handle high volumes of legitimate removal requests develop working relationships with platform legal teams. They understand what documentation formats are required, which legal frameworks each platform responds to, and how to escalate complex cases. A company handling five requests a month does not have these relationships.

<strong>They are outright scams.</strong> The FTC has pursued enforcement actions against several reputation management companies for deceptive practices. In 2024, the FTC settled with three firms for a combined $12.7 million in consumer refunds. Some companies collect payment and do essentially nothing. Others perform minimal work, file standard reports they know will be denied, and blame the platform.

<h2>Red Flags You Should Have Spotted</h2>

<p>Knowing these helps prevent the same mistake twice.</p>

<strong>Guaranteed results with no conditions.</strong> No legitimate service can guarantee 100% removal in every situation. A company that guarantees results without knowing specifics is making a promise it cannot keep.

<strong>Vague descriptions of their process.</strong> If the answer to "how will you remove this?" was "we have proprietary methods" or "our experts handle it," those are non-answers. A real process involves specific steps: documentation preparation, legal demand drafting, submission through identified channels, follow-up procedures, and escalation paths.

<strong>No legal component.</strong> Content removal for defamation requires legal documentation. If the company didn't discuss defamation law, didn't ask for evidence of falsity, and didn't have attorneys involved, they were not equipped for the job.

<strong>Upfront payment with no milestones or refund terms.</strong> Paying $4,200 with no contractual milestones or refund provisions is a significant red flag. Legitimate services align payment with results.

<strong>No verifiable track record.</strong> Could you find independent verification of actual removals from the specific platform? Could you speak with a previous client? If credibility existed only on their own website, that should have been a warning.

<strong>Pressure to sign immediately.</strong> "This price is only available today." Legitimate companies understand urgency but give clients time for informed decisions.

<h2>What Questions to Ask Before Hiring Again</h2>

<strong>"What is your specific process for removing content from [platform]?"</strong> The answer should include specific steps, channels, and documentation. At Tea App Green Flags, our process involves preparing legal documentation under applicable state law, submitting through Tea App's legal compliance channel, following up at defined intervals, and escalating through established contacts.

<strong>"Do you use legal channels or standard reporting?"</strong> Standard reporting is what you could do yourself. Legal channels are what you are paying a professional to access.

<strong>"What is your success rate for this specific platform?"</strong> "We have a high success rate" is not an answer. "Our success rate for Tea App defamation removal is approximately 92% over the past 12 months, based on 340 cases" is an answer.

<strong>"What happens if removal is not successful?"</strong> The answer should include refund provisions, alternative strategies, or continued efforts at no additional cost.

<strong>"Can I speak with a previous client?"</strong> Legitimate companies can arrange reference conversations. Privacy concerns are legitimate, but satisfied clients can usually take a brief call.

<strong>"Who prepares the legal documentation?"</strong> The answer should identify specific individuals with legal training. "Our team handles it" without identifying qualifications is insufficient.

<h2>What to Do Right Now If Your Previous Service Failed</h2>

<strong>Request a refund.</strong> Review your contract for refund provisions and submit a formal written request. If the company is unresponsive, send via certified mail.

<strong>File a credit card dispute.</strong> Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you have 60 days from the statement date to file a billing dispute for services not rendered. Credit card companies frequently rule in the consumer's favor.

<strong>File complaints.</strong> Submit to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov, your state attorney general's consumer protection division, and the Better Business Bureau.

<strong>Assess what was actually done.</strong> Before hiring again, understand what the previous company did and didn't do. Did they file standard reports? Submit legal demands? Do anything at all? Request copies of all work product generated on your behalf.

<strong>Evaluate the current state of the content.</strong> The post may have gained more engagement, spread to additional platforms, or been indexed by Google since you first hired help. <a href="/tea-app-removal-services">Our comprehensive assessment</a> evaluates every platform where content exists and identifies optimal removal pathways.

<h2>How Tea App Green Flags Differs</h2>

<strong>Direct legal removal channels, not standard reporting.</strong> Every request we submit goes through the platform's legal compliance channel. Our legal team prepares platform-specific documentation citing applicable defamation law and presenting evidence in the format each compliance team requires.

<strong>Established platform relationships.</strong> We have submitted thousands of removal requests to Tea App, Meta, and other platforms. That volume creates familiarity. Platform compliance teams recognize our documentation format and legal citations. When escalation is needed, we know who to contact.

<strong>DMCA expertise.</strong> Many defamatory posts include the victim's photographs or screenshots of private conversations. When these are your intellectual property, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA</a> takedown notices provide a parallel removal pathway that often produces faster results. We identify every applicable legal basis and pursue all channels simultaneously.

<strong>Attorney partner network.</strong> Some situations require cease-and-desist letters, emergency court orders, or defamation lawsuits. We maintain a network of defamation attorneys across multiple states who can be engaged quickly and integrate their legal actions with our platform removal efforts.

<strong>Transparent process with milestones.</strong> Our process includes defined stages: documentation preparation (days 1-3), platform submission (days 3-5), initial response (days 7-14), escalation if needed (days 14-21), and resolution (days 21-30 for standard cases, faster for <a href="/tea-app-emergency-removal">emergency cases</a>). You receive updates at each stage.

<h2>What to Expect When Switching Providers</h2>

<strong>Initial assessment.</strong> We review defamatory content in its current state, identify all platforms, evaluate what the previous company did, and determine optimal strategy. This consultation costs nothing.

<strong>Strategy development.</strong> If the previous company filed standard reports that were denied, we identify legal channels that bypass those denied reports entirely. If they attempted suppression, we set it aside and focus on actual removal.

<strong>Execution.</strong> Legal documentation is submitted through appropriate channels. <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">For Tea App content</a>, submissions go through legal compliance. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">For Facebook content</a>, legal demands go to Meta's compliance team. Multi-platform situations are coordinated for simultaneous removal.

<strong>Monitoring.</strong> After removal, <a href="/reputation-monitoring">reputation monitoring</a> provides ongoing surveillance. This is particularly important after a delayed removal because the passage of time increases the likelihood of copies and reposts across platforms.

<h2>The Cost of Delay</h2>

<p>Clients who come to us after a failed engagement often face a harder landscape. Posts live for 90 days have more engagement, shares, screenshots, and search engine authority than posts addressed in the first two weeks. Removal is still achievable. Our success rate for previously-attempted cases remains above 85%. But the effort and cost increase with time.</p>

<p>This is not said to pressure you. It is said because it is true. If you are reading this months after a failed attempt, the content has had additional time to embed itself in search results and community awareness. Acting now prevents further compounding.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward With Confidence</h2>

<p>Being failed by a reputation management company is frustrating and expensive. You trusted someone to solve a serious problem, and they didn't. But you are better informed now. You know what doesn't work. You know the red flags. You know the questions to ask. And you know that actual removal through legal channels with established platform relationships is fundamentally different from suppression, standard reporting, or fraud.</p>

<p>The defamatory content is still there. The consequences are still accumulating. The solution is the same as day one: get the content removed from the platforms where it lives, get it deindexed from Google, and set up monitoring to catch reappearance.</p>

If we can help, we will explain exactly how. If we cannot, we will tell you that too. Your reputation has waited long enough.
