    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue someone for falsely accusing me of having an STD online?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. False STD accusations are classified as defamation per se in most U.S. states, meaning the law presumes harm without requiring you to prove specific financial damages. Courts have consistently awarded $25,000 to over $500,000 in these cases. Tea App Green Flags can connect you with defamation attorneys experienced in these claims."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is defamation per se and how does it apply to false STD posts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Defamation per se is a legal doctrine that treats certain categories of false statements as so inherently damaging that harm is presumed automatically. False claims that someone has a communicable or loathsome disease, including any STD, fall squarely within this category. This makes false STD accusations among the strongest defamation cases you can bring."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I get a false STD accusation removed from Tea App?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Self-reporting through Tea App has a success rate below 5%. Professional removal services like Tea App Green Flags submit documented legal claims through platform legal channels, achieving removal in 10 to 21 business days with a 90-95% success rate. Emergency removal within 24-48 hours is available for actively spreading content."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What evidence do I need to fight a false STD accusation online?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You need a comprehensive STD panel from your healthcare provider on official letterhead, screenshots of every instance of the false accusation across all platforms, evidence of the spread and audience size, documentation of real-world damages, and any communications showing the poster knew the accusation was false. Tea App Green Flags helps clients build these evidence packages."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does it cost to sue for false STD defamation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Attorney fees typically range from $15,000 to $75,000, though many defamation attorneys take strong defamation per se cases on contingency, meaning no upfront cost. Cases generally take 12 to 24 months. Tea App Green Flags recommends pursuing professional post removal simultaneously so the content comes down in days rather than waiting for litigation to conclude."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can false STD accusations on Tea App spread to other platforms?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, and they frequently do within 48 hours. Tea App posts are commonly screenshot and shared to Facebook AWDTSG groups, Instagram stories, and group chats. Tea App Green Flags offers comprehensive cross-platform removal that addresses content on Tea App, Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms simultaneously."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What damages can I recover in a false STD defamation lawsuit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Under defamation per se, you can recover presumed general damages for reputational harm, humiliation, and mental anguish without proving specific losses. You may also recover special damages for documented financial harm and punitive damages if the poster knew the accusation was false. Verdicts have ranged from $25,000 to over $500,000."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do I have to take legal action for false STD accusations posted online?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most states impose a one to two year statute of limitations for defamation claims. Some states start the clock when the content is first posted, while others use a discovery rule starting when you first learned of the defamation. Acting quickly is critical because evidence degrades over time and the content continues spreading. Contact Tea App Green Flags immediately for a free consultation."}}]}

        <p>Three weeks ago, a man named Daniel called our office at 6:45 AM. His voice was flat and controlled in the way people sound when they've been awake all night cycling between panic and rage. A Tea App post had surfaced the previous evening accusing him of knowingly transmitting herpes to three different women. The post included his full name, his employer, a photo from his Hinge profile, and enough specific detail that people in the comments were identifying him by the second hour. By the time Daniel found out, the post had 260 comments. By morning, a screenshot had been shared in his city's "Are We Dating the Same Guy" Facebook group. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Daniel does not have herpes. He had full-panel STD test results from three weeks prior that confirmed it. But it didn't matter. The accusation was out there, attached to his real name and face, being read by thousands of people in his city. No amount of negative test results was going to undo the impression left by a viral social media post.</p>

<p>False STD accusations posted online represent one of the most devastating forms of defamation a person can experience. They attack the most intimate aspects of your life and create a stigma people are reluctant to look past even when presented with evidence of falsity. But the law takes these accusations more seriously than almost any other form of defamation, and your options for fighting back are stronger than you might realize.</p>

<h2>Why False STD Accusations Are Legally Different: Defamation Per Se</h2>

<p>Most defamation claims require the plaintiff to prove specific, quantifiable damages. You need to show you lost a job, lost clients, or suffered measurable financial harm. This damages requirement is often the hardest element to prove and the one that derails many cases.</p>

<p>False STD accusations belong to a special category called defamation per se. Under this doctrine, which exists in the vast majority of U.S. states, certain categories of false statements are considered so inherently damaging that the law presumes harm without requiring proof of specific damages. The traditional categories are false accusations of criminal conduct, false claims about professional competence, false statements imputing serious sexual misconduct, and false claims that a person has a loathsome or communicable disease.</p>

<p>That last category is directly on point. Accusing someone of having an STD, whether herpes, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, is a textbook case of defamation per se when the accusation is false. Courts across the country have consistently recognized this. In many jurisdictions, false STD accusations also trigger the "unchastity" category by implying sexual behavior that led to the infection.</p>

<p>What this means practically: you don't have to prove you lost your job. You don't have to quantify lost dates. The law presumes that being falsely accused of having an STD causes reputational damage, and you're entitled to compensation based on that presumption alone. In jurisdictions following the Restatement (Second) of Torts, damages can include presumed general damages for reputational harm, humiliation, and mental anguish, plus special damages if you can document them. Some states also allow punitive damages when the poster knew the accusation was false.</p>

<h2>Where False STD Accusations Commonly Appear</h2>

<strong>Tea App.</strong> As a platform built for sharing dating experiences, Tea App is ground zero for false STD accusations. The combination of emotional breakups, anonymous posting, and an audience primed to believe warnings creates an environment where false health claims spread rapidly. A single post can reach thousands within 24 hours in a mid-sized city.

<strong>Facebook "Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups.</strong> When a Tea App post gets screenshot and shared in an AWDTSG group, the audience multiplies. Some groups have tens of thousands of members. A <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Facebook defamation post in these groups</a> can be seen by an enormous number of people within hours.

<strong>Instagram.</strong> False STD accusations appear in stories, comments, and posts, often as screenshots from Tea App. Instagram stories are particularly dangerous because the 24-hour disappearing feature encourages rapid sharing and screenshot.

<strong>TeaOnHer and similar platforms.</strong> <a href="/tea-on-her-defamation-negative-post-removal">TeaOnHer</a> and related platforms function similarly to Tea App, and false STD accusations on these platforms carry the same legal weight and removal options.

<p>The cross-platform nature is what makes these accusations so damaging. A single false claim can be posted on Tea App, screenshot to Facebook, referenced on Instagram, discussed in group chats, and indexed by Google, all within 48 hours.</p>

<h2>The Real-World Impact</h2>

<strong>Dating and relationships.</strong> In 2026, searching potential dates online is standard practice. A false STD accusation that surfaces in that search ends most romantic prospects before they begin. People don't reach out to ask if the accusation is true. They simply move on to the next profile.

<strong>Professional consequences.</strong> A 2024 survey by the Reputation Management Association found that 78 percent of hiring managers acknowledged that negative social media content influenced hiring decisions, with health-related accusations among the most damaging categories.

<strong>Mental health.</strong> Clients consistently report anxiety, depression, insomnia, social withdrawal, and paranoia about who has seen the post. The intimate nature of the accusation creates a sense of violation that goes deeper than other forms of online defamation.

<strong>Social network erosion.</strong> Unlike a vague negative dating review, an STD accusation creates a specific, visceral reaction. Friends may distance themselves. Mutual acquaintances choose sides. Family members find out and react with a mixture of concern and judgment.

<h2>Documenting Your Case: Evidence That Matters</h2>

<strong>Medical evidence of falsity.</strong> Get a comprehensive STD panel test from your healthcare provider immediately. If you have recent negative results that predate the accusation, preserve those records. Ask your provider for official documentation on letterhead, not just a patient portal screenshot.

<strong>The defamatory content itself.</strong> Screenshot every instance across every platform. Capture the full post text, poster username, date, time, engagement metrics, and all comments. Use scrolling screenshots for complete threads.

<strong>Evidence of spread.</strong> Track every platform where the content has appeared. Document Facebook groups, Instagram posts, Reddit threads. Note audience sizes to establish the scope of exposure.

<strong>Evidence of damages.</strong> Document every impact: unmatches on dating apps, canceled dates (save the text messages), changes in professional interactions, messages from friends referencing the post. Keep a written journal noting daily impacts, including emotional distress, because these notes can become evidence. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support.

<strong>Evidence of the poster's knowledge.</strong> Prior text messages where the poster acknowledged your health status, communications showing revenge motivation, or evidence of contradictory statements to different people all support a finding of actual malice, which unlocks punitive damages.

<h2>Legal Remedies: Filing a Defamation Lawsuit</h2>

<p>With defamation per se working in your favor, a lawsuit for false STD accusations is among the strongest types of defamation cases.</p>

<strong>Finding the right attorney.</strong> You need a defamation attorney, not a general practice lawyer. Many offer free initial consultations and some take strong defamation per se cases on contingency, meaning they take a percentage of the recovery rather than charging hourly upfront.

<strong>The elements you need to prove.</strong> The statement was published on a viewable platform. It's a false statement of fact. It was made with at least negligence regarding truth. It falls within a defamation per se category. For false STD accusations, most elements are straightforward when the poster is someone who dated you and knows your actual health status.

<strong>Damages.</strong> Courts consider the severity of the accusation, breadth of publication, impact on personal and professional life, and evidence of malice. Verdicts and settlements in false STD accusation cases have ranged from $25,000 to over $500,000, with cases involving widespread publication and provable malice commanding the highest awards.

<strong>Timeline and cost reality.</strong> Even strong cases take twelve to twenty-four months. Attorney fees range from $15,000 to $75,000, though contingency arrangements can eliminate upfront costs. During litigation, the content may remain live unless you obtain a court-ordered injunction.

<h2>Removal Options: Getting the Content Down Now</h2>

<p>Legal action addresses accountability, but it doesn't address the immediate problem: the false accusation is live right now.</p>

<strong>Platform reporting.</strong> Every platform has a reporting mechanism, but success rates for self-reported defamation claims are under five percent on most major platforms. Standard reporting was not designed to handle complex defamation disputes and almost always fails for false STD accusations.

<strong>Professional removal services.</strong> <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Professional removal</a> achieves dramatically higher success rates using specialized methods unavailable to individual users. Typical timelines are ten to twenty-one business days, with <a href="/tea-app-emergency-removal">emergency removal within 24 to 48 hours</a> for actively spreading content. The specific approaches used are proprietary and tailored to each case.

<strong>Cross-platform removal.</strong> Because false STD accusations spread across multiple platforms, effective removal requires addressing content everywhere it appears. <a href="/tea-app-removal-services">Comprehensive removal services</a> coordinate removal across Tea App, Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms simultaneously, ensuring nothing is left behind.

<h2>State-by-State Legal Considerations</h2>

<strong>Statute of limitations.</strong> Most states impose a one to two year limit for defamation claims. Some apply the "single publication rule" starting the clock when content is first posted. Others apply a "discovery rule" starting when you knew or should have known about the defamation. This distinction matters for Tea App posts that circulate months before discovery.

<strong>Anti-SLAPP statutes.</strong> Approximately thirty states have anti-SLAPP laws allowing defendants to seek early dismissal. Some defendants in Tea App cases have argued that warning about health risks is protected speech. Courts have generally rejected this when statements are provably false, but these motions add cost and delay.

<strong>Criminal defamation.</strong> A handful of states maintain criminal defamation laws applicable to knowingly false statements about health or sexual conduct. While prosecutions are rare, these statutes provide additional leverage.

<h2>Protecting Yourself Going Forward</h2>

<strong>Medical documentation.</strong> Maintain regular STD testing records. Consistent documentation creates a timeline of evidence that can quickly disprove future false accusations.

<strong>Reputation monitoring.</strong> <a href="/reputation-monitoring">Professional monitoring services</a> continuously scan Tea App, Facebook groups, and Instagram for content mentioning your name or using your photos. Early detection is the single most important factor in minimizing damage.

<strong>Digital footprint management.</strong> Limit personal information available online. Review privacy settings and be selective about photos you share publicly.

<h2>Taking Action Now</h2>

<p>False STD accusations don't blow over. The stigma is persistent, deeply personal, and increasingly discoverable. Every day the content remains live is another day someone reads it, believes it, and adjusts their behavior toward you.</p>

<p>You have strong legal rights and effective removal options. The defamation per se standard means the law is on your side in a way that it isn't for many other types of online defamation. But rights don't enforce themselves.</p>

<p>Start with evidence preservation. Get tested to confirm your medical records support your position. Document every instance of the false accusation. Then <a href="/tea-app-emergency-removal">contact our team for an emergency consultation</a>. We specialize in removing exactly this type of content from Tea App and related platforms, and we understand that false health accusations demand immediate action. The sooner the content comes down, the fewer people see it, the less it spreads, and the faster you can begin rebuilding. Don't wait for this to resolve itself. It won't.</p>
