If the post contains false statements of fact that have damaged your reputation, you can file a defamation lawsuit against the poster. You'll need to prove the statements are false, they were published to third parties, they caused measurable damages, and the poster acted with at least negligence. Several major lawsuits have been filed against AWDTSG posters with varying outcomes."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happened in the D'Ambrosio v. Meta AWDTSG lawsuit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Filed in Chicago in 2024, D'Ambrosio v. Meta attempted to hold Facebook (Meta) liable for hosting defamatory AWDTSG content under the Illinois Anti-Doxing Act. The case was largely dismissed in 2025 because Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields platforms like Facebook from liability for user-generated content. The case demonstrated that suing the platform is generally not viable — claims must be directed at individual posters."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the Murrey v. Does AWDTSG lawsuit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Filed in Los Angeles, Murrey v. Does named 50+ anonymous AWDTSG group members as defendants, alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Quinlan, decided in Canada in 2025, found that an AWDTSG group administrator was personally liable for defamatory content posted in the group she managed. The court held that the admin had a duty to moderate content and could be held responsible for failing to remove defamatory posts after being notified. While this is a Canadian case, it signals a potential direction for admin liability arguments."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does an AWDTSG defamation lawsuit cost?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"AWDTSG defamation lawsuits typically cost between $15,000 and $150,000 or more depending on case complexity, jurisdiction, and whether the case proceeds to trial. Attorney retainers start at $5,000-$15,000. Discovery, depositions, and trial preparation add significant costs. Most cases settle or are resolved before trial, but total fees still commonly reach $30,000-$75,000."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it worth suing over an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Suing is worth considering only in severe cases where the content is demonstrably false, has caused significant measurable damages (lost job, lost clients, documented emotional distress), and you have the budget and emotional capacity for lengthy litigation. For most AWDTSG cases, professional removal services ($300-$1,500, 92-95% success rate, 30-90 days) achieve the primary goal — getting the content removed — far more quickly and affordably."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue Facebook (Meta) for hosting AWDTSG groups?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As demonstrated by D'Ambrosio v. Meta, suing Facebook for hosting AWDTSG content is extremely difficult due to [Section 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) protections. Section 230 immunizes platforms from liability for user-generated content. While some legal theories challenge Section 230's scope, no court has held Facebook liable for AWDTSG group content. Claims should be directed at individual posters and, potentially, group administrators."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can AWDTSG group admins be held legally liable?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Potentially, yes — especially after the Belliveau v. Quinlan decision in Canada. In the US, admin liability is less established but legal theories are developing. Admins who actively participate in creating defamatory content, refuse to remove posts after being notified of false claims, or actively promote or amplify defamatory posts may face liability depending on jurisdiction. Section 230's protection of admins who merely host content is being tested in multiple courts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What damages can I recover in an AWDTSG lawsuit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Potential damages include compensatory damages for lost income, lost business opportunities, and medical expenses related to emotional distress. Many states recognize defamation per se for false claims of criminal behavior or sexual misconduct, allowing presumed damages without specific proof. Punitive damages may be available if the poster acted with actual malice. Court-ordered injunctions can also require content removal and prohibit future posting."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does an AWDTSG defamation lawsuit take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most AWDTSG defamation lawsuits take 6-24 months from filing to resolution, with complex cases extending beyond two years. The process includes filing, discovery (which involves subpoenas to Facebook to identify anonymous posters), depositions, potential motions to dismiss or anti-SLAPP motions, and either settlement or trial. Many cases settle during discovery or pre-trial phases."}}]}

        <p>The legal landscape around Are We Dating the Same Guy groups is evolving rapidly. In 2024 and 2025, several major lawsuits challenged AWDTSG groups, their administrators, and the platform that hosts them. These cases have established important precedents — and revealed the significant limitations — of using the legal system to address AWDTSG posts.</p>

<p>Whether you're considering a lawsuit, evaluating your legal rights, or simply trying to understand the options, this guide covers the major AWDTSG cases, what they mean, and how they should inform your removal strategy.</p>

<h2>The Three Landmark AWDTSG Cases</h2>

<p>Three cases stand out as the most significant legal actions involving AWDTSG groups. Each tested a different legal theory, targeted a different type of defendant, and produced a different outcome. Together, they paint a comprehensive picture of where AWDTSG litigation stands in 2026.</p>

<h2>Case 1: D'Ambrosio v. Meta (Chicago, 2024-2025)</h2>

<h3>The Background</h3>

<p>In 2024, a Chicago man identified as D'Ambrosio filed suit against Meta Platforms, Inc. — the parent company of Facebook — alleging that the platform was liable for defamatory content posted about him in a Chicago-area AWDTSG group.</p>

<p>The complaint centered on a novel legal theory: that Meta's hosting of AWDTSG groups violated the Illinois Anti-Doxing Act, a state law that prohibits the publication of personally identifiable information with the intent to threaten or harass. D'Ambrosio argued that by allowing AWDTSG groups to operate, Meta was facilitating the publication of men's personal information — names, photos, workplaces, neighborhoods — in a context designed to damage their reputations.</p>

<p>The case attracted significant attention because it represented the first major attempt to hold the platform itself — rather than individual posters — responsible for AWDTSG content.</p>

<h3>The Legal Theory</h3>

<p>D'Ambrosio's legal team advanced several arguments:</p>

<strong>Illinois Anti-Doxing Act.</strong> The complaint alleged that AWDTSG posts constituted "doxing" under Illinois law by publishing personal information (photos, names, identifying details) with the effect of subjecting the individual to harassment and reputational harm.

<strong>Platform liability beyond Section 230.</strong> The argument attempted to carve an exception to Section 230 by framing Meta's role not as a passive platform hosting user content, but as an active facilitator of a system designed to harm specific individuals.

<strong>Knowledge and inaction.</strong> The complaint alleged that Meta knew AWDTSG groups routinely hosted defamatory content and chose to allow the groups to continue operating for commercial reasons (user engagement and advertising revenue).

<h3>The Outcome</h3>

<p>The case was largely dismissed in 2025. The court held that:</p>

<strong>Section 230 applied.</strong> Meta's role as a platform hosting user-generated content fell squarely within Section 230's safe harbor protections. The court found no basis for treating AWDTSG groups differently from any other user-created Facebook group. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.

<strong>The Anti-Doxing Act didn't override Section 230.</strong> While the Illinois Anti-Doxing Act creates liability for individuals who dox others, the court held that it does not create liability for platforms that host doxing content. Section 230 preempts state laws that attempt to impose platform liability for user content.

<strong>Meta's knowledge was insufficient.</strong> The court found that general knowledge that AWDTSG groups exist and sometimes contain harmful content did not transform Meta from a passive host into an active participant in the alleged harm.

<h3>What D'Ambrosio Means for You</h3>

<strong>You cannot effectively sue Facebook for hosting AWDTSG content.</strong> Section 230 remains a formidable shield for platforms. Until federal legislation changes Section 230 (which is being discussed in Congress but hasn't happened), the platform itself is not a viable defendant.

<strong>State anti-doxing laws have limited reach.</strong> While these laws can be powerful against individual posters, they don't create a backdoor to platform liability.

<strong>Your claims must target individual posters.</strong> The legal system points you toward the people who actually created and posted the defamatory content — not the platform that hosted it.

<h2>Don't Wait for Legal Precedent — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Lawsuits take 6-24 months. Your AWDTSG post is doing damage right now.</strong> While the legal system evolves, professional removal gets results in 30-90 days with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation today</a>.

<h2>Case 2: Murrey v. Does (Los Angeles, 2024-2025)</h2>

<h3>The Background</h3>

<p>Murrey v. Does took a fundamentally different approach. Instead of suing the platform, a Los Angeles man identified as Murrey filed suit against more than 50 anonymous members of an LA-area AWDTSG group. The complaint alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy.</p>

<p>The case received significant media coverage, with reports from NPR, the LA Times, and numerous legal blogs. It became a flashpoint in the broader cultural debate about AWDTSG groups — are they safety tools for women or anonymous defamation platforms?</p>

<h3>The Scale</h3>

<p>What made Murrey v. Does exceptional was its scope:</p>

<strong>50+ defendants.</strong> Rather than suing a single poster, Murrey's legal team targeted dozens of group members who had commented on, shared, or amplified the original post. The legal theory was that each person who added defamatory comments or shared the content was independently liable.

<strong>John/Jane Doe defendants.</strong> Because AWDTSG members use their personal Facebook profiles, the defendants were initially identified by their Facebook display names. Murrey's team filed subpoenas to Meta demanding the real identities behind those profiles.

<strong>Discovery battles.</strong> Meta initially resisted the subpoenas, arguing that disclosing user identities would chill free expression. The court ultimately ordered Meta to comply with some but not all subpoena requests, requiring Murrey to demonstrate a prima facie defamation claim before unmasking each defendant.

<h3>The Key Legal Issues</h3>

<strong>Anonymous speech protections.</strong> Courts generally protect anonymous speech under the First Amendment. To unmask anonymous defendants, plaintiffs must meet heightened standards — typically demonstrating that their claims have substantive merit before discovery is permitted.

<strong>Defamation vs. opinion.</strong> A central fight in Murrey was distinguishing between actionable false statements of fact and protected expressions of opinion. Comments like "he's the worst guy I've ever dated" are likely protected opinion. Claims like "he gave me a sexually transmitted disease" or "he was arrested for assault" are provably false factual assertions — and potentially actionable.

<strong>Group liability.</strong> The case tested whether sharing, liking, or commenting on a defamatory post creates independent liability. Different jurisdictions treat this differently, and the issue remains unsettled.

<h3>The Media Dimension</h3>

<p>The NPR and LA Times coverage of Murrey v. Does added a complicating dimension. The lawsuit itself became a news story, which meant:</p>

<li>Murrey's name became publicly associated with the AWDTSG controversy</li>
<li>The allegations from the AWDTSG post received broader distribution through news coverage</li>
<li>The cultural debate framed Murrey's lawsuit in terms of "man suing women for talking about their dating experiences" — a narrative that generated public sympathy for the defendants</li>
<li>Defense attorneys used the media narrative to pressure for settlement or dismissal</li>

<h3>What Murrey Means for You</h3>

<strong>Suing individual posters is legally viable but practically complex.</strong> Identifying anonymous posters requires subpoenas, court orders, and significant legal expense before you can even name your defendants.

<strong>Scope creates cost.</strong> Pursuing 50+ defendants means 50+ sets of legal motions, discovery requests, and potential depositions. Costs escalate rapidly and can easily exceed $100,000.

<strong>Media coverage is a double-edged sword.</strong> If your case attracts press attention, the lawsuit itself can amplify the very content you're trying to suppress.

<strong>The Streisand Effect is real.</strong> Some AWDTSG posts that would have faded from memory become permanent internet fixtures because the lawsuit drew public attention to them.

<strong>Settlement is the realistic outcome.</strong> Most multi-defendant AWDTSG lawsuits, if they proceed, end in individual settlements where defendants agree to remove content and refrain from future posting. These settlements are often confidential.

<h2>Case 3: Belliveau v. Quinlan (Canada, 2025)</h2>

<h3>The Background</h3>

<p>While not a US case, Belliveau v. Quinlan has significant implications for the AWDTSG legal landscape globally — and may preview where US courts are heading. The case was heard in Canada in 2025 and addressed a question that US courts haven't definitively answered: <strong>can AWDTSG group administrators be held personally liable for defamatory posts they didn't write?</strong></p>

<p>The plaintiff, Belliveau, alleged that an administrator of a Canadian AWDTSG-style dating group allowed defamatory content about him to remain in the group after being notified that the claims were false. Rather than suing the original poster alone, Belliveau targeted the group administrator, Quinlan, arguing that she had a duty to moderate content in the group she controlled.</p>

<h3>The Ruling</h3>

<p>The court found in favor of Belliveau on the admin liability question, establishing several important principles:</p>

<strong>Admins have a duty to moderate.</strong> The court held that by creating and maintaining a group that facilitated discussions about identifiable individuals, the admin assumed a responsibility to act on credible complaints about false content.

<strong>Notice creates obligation.</strong> Once the admin was put on notice that specific content was false and defamatory, her failure to investigate and remove the content constituted a breach of duty.

<strong>Admin is not merely a passive host.</strong> The court distinguished between Facebook (the platform, protected by platform immunity doctrines) and the group admin (an individual who actively created, managed, and benefited from the group). The admin's active role — setting group rules, approving members, moderating some content while leaving other content up — made her more than a passive intermediary.

<strong>Personal liability for damages.</strong> Quinlan was found personally liable for damages resulting from the defamatory content she failed to remove after notification. The specific damages amount was based on demonstrated harm to Belliveau's personal and professional reputation.

<h3>Limitations and Context</h3>

<strong>Canadian law differs from US law.</strong> Canada does not have an equivalent to Section 230. Canadian law generally imposes higher duties on content intermediaries than US law does. Direct application of Belliveau to US courts is uncertain.

<strong>Active vs. passive admin role matters.</strong> The ruling emphasized Quinlan's active management of the group. An admin who is entirely hands-off might face a different analysis — although the court suggested that creating a group inherently involves some level of management responsibility.

<strong>Notice is the trigger.</strong> The admin wasn't liable simply for hosting the group. Liability attached because she was notified of false content and chose not to act. This "notice and failure to act" framework is similar to how some US courts analyze potential admin liability.

<h3>What Belliveau Means for You</h3>

<strong>Admin liability is a developing legal theory.</strong> While not yet established in US law, the Belliveau reasoning provides a framework that US plaintiffs' attorneys are beginning to cite.

<strong>Notifying admins creates a paper trail.</strong> Sending a formal notification to an AWDTSG group admin identifying specific false content creates the foundation for a potential admin liability claim. Even if the admin doesn't remove the content, the notification becomes evidence in any future legal proceeding.

<strong>International precedent influences US discourse.</strong> US courts regularly consider international decisions when analyzing novel legal questions. Belliveau's reasoning may influence how US courts approach AWDTSG admin liability cases in the coming years.

<strong>Admin liability adds a removal tool.</strong> Even without filing a lawsuit, citing Belliveau in a demand letter to an AWDTSG admin may increase the likelihood of voluntary removal. Admins who are aware of potential personal liability are more likely to take removal requests seriously.

<h2>Beyond the Big Three: Other Notable Cases</h2>

<h3>State-Level Defamation Actions</h3>

<p>Dozens of smaller AWDTSG defamation cases have been filed across the US, most of which settle before trial. Common patterns include:</p>

<li>Individual defamation suits against a single poster, typically settling for content removal plus a modest financial payment</li>
<li>Cease and desist letters that result in voluntary removal without litigation</li>
<li>Small claims court filings in states that allow defamation claims in small claims (damage caps typically $5,000-$10,000)</li>

<h3>Anti-SLAPP Complications</h3>

<p>Several AWDTSG defendants have filed anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) motions, arguing that their posts constitute protected speech on matters of public concern. In states with strong anti-SLAPP statutes (California, Texas, Oregon, and others), successful anti-SLAPP motions result in:</p>

<li>Dismissal of the plaintiff's claims</li>
<li>The plaintiff being ordered to pay the defendant's attorney fees</li>
<li>A chilling effect on future AWDTSG lawsuits in that jurisdiction</li>

<p>Anti-SLAPP is a serious risk for AWDTSG plaintiffs in strong anti-SLAPP states. Consulting with a <a href="/blog/awdtsg-defamation-legal-rights">defamation attorney who understands anti-SLAPP law</a> is essential before filing.</p>

<h2>When to Sue vs. When to Use Professional Removal</h2>

<p>The cases above illustrate a clear pattern: AWDTSG lawsuits are expensive, slow, unpredictable, and sometimes counterproductive. But they're not always the wrong choice. Here's a framework for deciding.</p>

<h3>Consider a Lawsuit When:</h3>

<li><strong>The content is severely defamatory</strong> with specific false factual claims (false accusations of crimes, diseases, violence)</li>
<li><strong>You have documented financial damages</strong> — lost job, lost clients, lost business opportunities directly attributable to the AWDTSG post</li>
<li><strong>You need court-ordered protection</strong> — a restraining order against the poster, an injunction against re-posting</li>
<li><strong>Financial recovery matters</strong> — you want compensatory and potentially punitive damages, not just removal</li>
<li><strong>You've identified the poster</strong> — knowing who posted avoids the expensive discovery process</li>
<li><strong>Anti-SLAPP risk is low</strong> — you're in a jurisdiction without strong anti-SLAPP laws, or the content clearly falls outside anti-SLAPP protection</li>
<li><strong>You have the budget</strong> — $15,000-$150,000+ and the emotional capacity for 6-24 months of litigation</li>

<h3>Choose Professional Removal When:</h3>

<li><strong>Your primary goal is getting the content removed</strong> — not financial damages or legal precedent</li>
<li><strong>Speed matters</strong> — you need results in 30-90 days, not 6-24 months</li>
<li><strong>Budget is a factor</strong> — $300-$1,500 vs. $15,000-$150,000+</li>
<li><strong>The post is harmful but not catastrophically defamatory</strong> — it's damaging your dating life and reputation but hasn't caused documented financial losses</li>
<li><strong>You want to avoid publicity</strong> — lawsuits can become public; professional removal is discrete</li>
<li><strong>The content has spread</strong> — removal services address cross-platform spread; lawsuits typically address only the original post</li>
<li><strong>You want monitoring and re-post prevention</strong> — <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional services</a> include ongoing protection</li>

<h3>The Hybrid Approach</h3>

<p>For severe cases, the most effective strategy often combines professional removal with legal action:</p>

<li><strong>Engage a professional removal service immediately</strong> to address the content and stop the spread</li>
<li><strong>Consult a defamation attorney</strong> to assess legal viability and begin building a case</li>
<li><strong>Use the removal service</strong> for fast content takedown while the legal process unfolds</li>
<li><strong>Pursue legal action</strong> for damages and injunctive relief once the immediate reputational bleeding has stopped</li>

<p>This approach gives you fast removal (30-90 days via professional service) while preserving your legal options for financial recovery on a longer timeline.</p>

<h2>Cost Comparison: Lawsuit vs. Professional Removal</h2>

<p>| Factor | Lawsuit | Professional Removal |</p>
<p>|--------|---------|---------------------|</p>
<p>| <strong>Upfront Cost</strong> | $5,000-$15,000 retainer | $300-$1,500 total |</p>
<p>| <strong>Total Cost</strong> | $15,000-$150,000+ | $300-$1,500 |</p>
<p>| <strong>Timeline</strong> | 6-24 months | 30-90 days |</p>
<p>| <strong>Success Rate</strong> | 60-80% (variable) | 92-95% |</p>
<p>| <strong>Content Removal</strong> | If won/settled | Primary objective |</p>
<p>| <strong>Financial Damages</strong> | Possible | No |</p>
<p>| <strong>Cross-Platform</strong> | Usually not | Yes |</p>
<p>| <strong>Privacy</strong> | Public record | Confidential |</p>
<p>| <strong>Emotional Toll</strong> | High | Low |</p>
<p>| <strong>Re-post Prevention</strong> | Injunction (if granted) | Monitoring included |</p>

<h2>What These Cases Mean for the Future</h2>

<p>The legal landscape around AWDTSG groups is still evolving. Several trends are emerging:</p>

<strong>Platform immunity remains strong.</strong> Section 230 continues to shield Facebook from liability for AWDTSG content. Until Congress acts, suing Meta is not a viable strategy.

<strong>Individual poster liability is established.</strong> Courts consistently recognize that individual posters can be sued for defamatory AWDTSG content. The challenge is practical (identifying posters, proving falsity, managing costs), not legal.

<strong>Admin liability is developing.</strong> Belliveau v. Quinlan opened the door to admin liability claims. US courts will likely address this question directly in the coming years.

<strong>Anti-SLAPP remains a significant defense.</strong> In strong anti-SLAPP jurisdictions, defendants have a powerful tool to dismiss cases and recover fees. Plaintiffs must carefully evaluate this risk.

<strong>Media attention creates complications.</strong> High-profile lawsuits can amplify the very content they seek to address. The Streisand Effect is a genuine concern.

<strong>Professional removal fills the gap.</strong> For the majority of AWDTSG targets — people who want the content removed efficiently and affordably — professional removal services offer what the legal system currently cannot: fast, reliable, discrete results at a fraction of the cost of litigation.

<h2>Take the Right Next Step</h2>

<p>If you've been posted in an AWDTSG group and you're weighing your options:</p>

<li><strong>Document everything</strong> — regardless of which path you choose, you need evidence</li>
<li><strong>Get a free consultation</strong> — <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">contact our team</a> to understand your specific situation</li>
<li><strong>Don't rush to the courthouse</strong> — a lawsuit filed in anger often creates more problems than it solves</li>
<li><strong>Consider removal first, legal action second</strong> — get the content down quickly, then pursue damages if appropriate</li>
<li><strong>Consult a defamation attorney</strong> for severe cases — but choose one who understands AWDTSG and anti-SLAPP law</li>

<p>The legal system is slowly catching up to the reality of AWDTSG groups. In the meantime, you don't have to wait for the courts to act. Effective removal solutions exist today.</p>
