        <p>Kansas City straddles two states, but when it comes to the AWDTSG Facebook group, there are no borders. Thirteen thousand women across the KC metro — from the Power and Light District to the Country Club Plaza to Westport to the Kansas suburbs of Overland Park and Olathe — all share a single group where false accusations can destroy your reputation on both sides of the state line. If you've been posted in the Kansas City "Are We Dating The Same Guy" Facebook group, you're facing damage that crosses not just social circles but state borders. Kansas City AWDTSG removal needs to start immediately.</p>

<p>Kansas City's dating scene is warm, genuine, and community-oriented. The BBQ joints, the Crossroads Arts District, the Westport bar scene, and the growing downtown nightlife create a social environment where people connect face to face. But that same community warmth means AWDTSG posts cut deeper here — because in KC, the women reading that post aren't strangers. They're the people you see at the farmer's market, at Sporting KC games, and at every neighborhood gathering.</p>

<h2>The Kansas City AWDTSG Group: What You're Up Against</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Kansas City" Facebook group has over <strong>13,000 members</strong> and is the primary AWDTSG group for the KC metro area. The group is restricted to women only — men cannot view posts, see comments, or request removal directly. You can find it at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/2199028780253564/">facebook.com/groups/2199028780253564/</a>. All posts are subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 13,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>The Kansas City AWDTSG group uniquely spans two states — Missouri and Kansas. Members come from both the Missouri side (KCMO, Independence, Lee's Summit, Liberty) and the Kansas side (Overland Park, Olathe, Lenexa, Shawnee). This dual-state membership creates a broader audience than the member count alone suggests and introduces multi-jurisdictional legal complexities for removal.</p>

<p>Activity peaks on weekends, especially after nights out in Westport, the Power and Light District, and along the Crossroads. The group maintains consistent engagement throughout the week as members share dating experiences from across the entire KC metro.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Kansas City AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 12,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Kansas City</h2>

<p>Kansas City's social geography is organized around a handful of key entertainment and social districts that serve the entire metro. Westport attracts the young professional crowd. Power and Light brings the nightlife energy. The Crossroads Arts District draws the creative community. The Country Club Plaza serves the upscale dating scene. These areas draw people from both sides of the state line into shared social spaces.</p>

<p>Kansas City AWDTSG content spreads through:</p>

<li><strong>Westport and Power and Light social networks</strong> — KC's primary nightlife districts have tight communities where AWDTSG screenshots circulate through friend groups and industry connections.</li>
<li><strong>Johnson County suburban networks</strong> — The Kansas suburbs have their own social ecosystem that overlaps with KCMO's dating scene. Posts reach women in Overland Park, Olathe, and Shawnee alongside downtown KC residents.</li>
<li><strong>Kansas City's corporate community</strong> — Major employers like Cerner (Oracle Health), Sprint/T-Mobile, Hallmark, and the federal agencies at the Bannister complex create professional networks where AWDTSG posts circulate.</li>
<li><strong>St. Louis crossover</strong> — The Kansas City and St. Louis AWDTSG groups cross-post regularly, especially for men described as dating across Missouri's two major cities along the I-70 corridor.</li>

<p>Kansas City's Midwest character means social circles extend through church communities, youth sports networks, and family connections in ways that coastal cities don't experience. AWDTSG posts reach beyond the dating world into these deeper community networks.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal services</a> understand Kansas City's dual-state social landscape and act quickly to contain posts before they penetrate both Missouri and Kansas social networks.

<h2>Missouri and Kansas Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Kansas City's unique position spanning Missouri and Kansas means two sets of defamation laws potentially apply to any AWDTSG case. Professional removal services leverage the most favorable provisions from both states.</p>

<strong><a href="https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=509.210">Missouri defamation law</a></strong> provides strong protections under Missouri common law. Missouri recognizes defamation per se for false statements accusing someone of criminal conduct, imputing a loathsome disease, or injuring someone in their profession. The statute of limitations in Missouri is <strong>two years</strong> from publication.

<strong>Kansas defamation law</strong> under Kansas common law similarly recognizes defamation per se for accusations of criminal conduct, loathsome disease, and professional injury. Kansas has a <strong>one-year statute of limitations</strong> for defamation, making prompt action essential for posts that reach the Kansas side of the metro.

<p>For Kansas City AWDTSG posts, the poster's location and the distribution of the audience across both states determine which laws apply. Having two states' worth of defamation protections available strengthens the legal leverage for removal. Professional removal services understand these jurisdictional nuances and craft documentation that maximizes pressure from both Missouri and Kansas law.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Kansas City AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/263149623790594">Facebook's standard reporting process</a> fails for Kansas City AWDTSG posts. Group admins reject removal requests, and Facebook's automated system doesn't flag these posts as violations.

<p>Professional Kansas City AWDTSG removal includes:</p>

<strong>Dual-state legal documentation.</strong> Our notices cite both Missouri and Kansas defamation law, leveraging the strongest provisions from each state for maximum removal leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.

<strong>Metro-wide content sweep.</strong> We remove the original KC post and track every share across Instagram, Reddit, the St. Louis AWDTSG group, and all platforms where Kansas City content has spread on both sides of the state line.

<strong>Search engine management.</strong> We deindex Google results connecting your name to Kansas City AWDTSG content — critical for KC professionals whose employers conduct online searches.

<strong>Post-removal monitoring.</strong> Kansas City's community networks mean content gets referenced and reshared. We monitor continuously and act immediately on any resurfaced content.

<p>Our Kansas City AWDTSG removal services achieve a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong> with an average timeline of <strong>30 to 90 days</strong>. Expedited options are available for KC professionals facing immediate career consequences.</p>

<p>For multi-platform defamation, our <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App defamation removal service</a> handles dating platform removal with the same proven approach.</p>

<h2>Kansas City's Community Values Demand Action</h2>

<p>Kansas City is a city that values community, loyalty, and genuine human connection. When a false AWDTSG post corrupts those values by spreading lies about someone in the community, it violates everything KC stands for. But the group's internal culture doesn't allow for correction — any attempt to challenge a post is viewed as silencing women's voices.</p>

<p>The only effective response is professional, behind-the-scenes removal that doesn't trigger community backlash. Legal documentation routed through Facebook's compliance team bypasses the group's internal dynamics entirely, achieving removal without the Streisand Effect that makes every DIY attempt in Kansas City backfire.</p>

<p>Your reputation in KC matters. On both sides of the state line, in every neighborhood from Brookside to the Northland to Johnson County, the people who matter to you deserve to know the real you — not the version fabricated in an AWDTSG post. Professional removal makes that possible.</p>
