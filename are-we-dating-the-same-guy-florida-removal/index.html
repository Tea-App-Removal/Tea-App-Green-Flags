        <p>Florida is one of the most dangerous states in the country for AWDTSG exposure. With massive groups in Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Fort Lauderdale — totaling well over 95,000 combined members — a false post in a Florida AWDTSG group reaches an enormous audience at terrifying speed. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. Florida's transient population, vibrant nightlife, and active dating culture mean these groups are among the most engaged in the nation.</p>

<p>If someone has posted your name and photo in a Florida AWDTSG group, the damage is compounding every minute. But <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2024/0770.01">Florida's defamation laws</a> provide strong legal leverage, and professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Florida</h2>

<p>Florida has more active AWDTSG groups than nearly any other state, reflecting its large population, tourism-driven social scene, and dispersed metro areas.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Miami</strong> — Over 40,000 members covering Miami-Dade County including South Beach, Brickell, Coral Gables, Wynwood, and the broader South Florida dating scene</li>
<li><strong>Tampa</strong> — Over 20,000 members covering the Tampa Bay area including St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Brandon, and the Hillsborough-Pinellas corridor</li>
<li><strong>Orlando</strong> — Over 16,000 members covering Central Florida including Winter Park, Kissimmee, Lake Nona, and the I-4 corridor</li>
<li><strong>Jacksonville</strong> — Over 10,000 members covering Northeast Florida including the Beaches, St. Augustine, Orange Park, and Fleming Island</li>
<li><strong>Fort Lauderdale</strong> — Over 9,000 members covering Broward County including Hollywood, Plantation, Coral Springs, and Pompano Beach</li>
<li><strong>West Palm Beach</strong> — Active group covering Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast</li>
<li><strong>Sarasota/Bradenton</strong> — Serving the Gulf Coast south of Tampa</li>
<li><strong>Gainesville</strong> — University of Florida community with high engagement during academic terms</li>
<li><strong>Tallahassee</strong> — State capital and Florida State University community</li>
<li><strong>Naples/Fort Myers</strong> — Covering the Southwest Florida coast</li>
<li><strong>Pensacola</strong> — Serving the Florida Panhandle including NAS Pensacola and the Emerald Coast</li>
<li><strong>Daytona Beach</strong> — Covering the Central Atlantic coast</li>

<p>The South Florida triangle — Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach — has nearly 55,000 combined AWDTSG members. Posts freely cross between these overlapping groups. A single accusation in Brickell can reach women from Key West to Jupiter within a day.</p>

<p>Florida's massive tourism and seasonal resident population adds another dimension. Snowbirds and seasonal visitors join local groups and carry information back to AWDTSG groups in their home states, spreading Florida posts to New York, Chicago, and beyond.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Florida Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Florida has 20 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 22.2M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Florida Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Florida provides strong defamation protections with some unique features that benefit AWDTSG victims. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong>Florida Statute § 770.01 through § 770.09</strong> governs defamation in the state. Florida requires that before filing a civil defamation action, the plaintiff must give the publisher <strong>five days' written notice</strong> specifying the defamatory statements. This pre-suit notice requirement under § 770.01 actually works in your favor for removal — it creates a formal legal demand that often prompts immediate takedown without litigation.

<p>Florida recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute a criminal offense</li>
<li>Impute an infectious or loathsome disease</li>
<li>Tend to injure someone in their trade or profession</li>
<li>Impute unchastity or sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, damages are presumed. AWDTSG posts routinely contain exactly these types of false accusations. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.</p>

<p>The statute of limitations for defamation in Florida is <strong>two years</strong> under <strong>Florida Statute § 95.11(4)(g)</strong>. Florida courts have recognized that online republication can constitute new publication for limitations purposes.</p>

<strong>Florida Statute § 836.04 and § 836.05</strong> address criminal defamation (written and spoken), providing additional legal leverage. While criminal prosecution is uncommon, the statutes' existence strengthens removal demands.

<strong>Florida Statute § 784.048</strong> covers cyberstalking, and its broad definition can encompass coordinated AWDTSG harassment campaigns. Florida's cyberstalking law is among the most comprehensive in the nation.

<p>Florida's <strong>right of publicity (F.S. § 540.08)</strong> protects against unauthorized commercial use of your name and likeness. When AWDTSG posts are shared, screenshotted, and monetized through engagement, this statute may provide additional legal tools.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Florida</h2>

<p>Our Florida removal process is built for the state's uniquely active AWDTSG landscape, where multiple large groups require simultaneous attention.</p>

<strong>Statewide Group Mapping.</strong> We identify every instance of the defamatory post across Florida's twelve or more active AWDTSG groups. South Florida's overlapping Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach groups require particular attention.

<strong>Pre-Suit Notice Strategy.</strong> Florida's unique pre-suit notice requirement under § 770.01 becomes a powerful removal tool. Our formally drafted five-day notice, citing specific defamatory statements and applicable statutes, creates immediate legal urgency that often results in voluntary removal before any lawsuit is filed.

<strong>Multi-Metro Coordination.</strong> Posts in Florida frequently appear in multiple city groups simultaneously. We coordinate removal across Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and all other affected groups at once to prevent content from migrating between groups.

<strong>Tourism Crossover Monitoring.</strong> We track whether Florida AWDTSG posts have been carried to out-of-state groups by seasonal residents or visitors. This cross-state spreading is a uniquely Florida problem that requires expanded monitoring.

<strong>Platform and Search Cleanup.</strong> Beyond Facebook, we handle Instagram, Reddit, Google deindexing, and any other platform where Florida AWDTSG content has appeared. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<p>Most Florida removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>

<h2>Florida Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under Fla. Stat. § 770, Florida provides a 2 years statute of limitations for defamation claims. Florida recognizes defamation per se, meaning damages are presumed for certain categories of false statements. Florida courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in FL county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites Fla. Stat. § 770 and applicable Florida case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
