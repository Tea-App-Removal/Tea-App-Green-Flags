        <p>Someone posted false claims about you in an AWDTSG group. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. You know they're lies. But knowing something is false and proving it in a way that compels removal or supports legal action are two very different challenges.</p>

<p>This guide explains how to systematically build proof that AWDTSG accusations are false, what types of evidence carry the most weight, and how that evidence translates into effective removal and legal outcomes.</p>

<h2>Why Proof Matters Even for Removal</h2>

<p>You might wonder why you need to prove anything when you're the one being wronged. The reality is that proof strengthens every avenue of response:</p>

<strong>For professional removal:</strong> Documented evidence of falsity gives <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">removal services</a> additional leverage when working to eliminate content. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment. It demonstrates the seriousness of the situation and supports the urgency of removal requests.

<strong>For legal action:</strong> Courts require evidence. The strength of your proof directly determines whether an attorney will take your case, whether a demand letter carries weight, and whether a lawsuit succeeds. See our <a href="/blog/awdtsg-lawsuit-guide">lawsuit guide</a> for detailed legal information.

<strong>For personal clarity:</strong> Systematically documenting the truth helps counteract the psychological damage of being falsely accused. It shifts you from a reactive, emotional state to a proactive, evidence-based position.

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up, more people see it.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, exposure compounds fast. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>.


<h2>Common False Accusations and How to Disprove Each</h2>

<h3>Criminal Behavior Allegations</h3>

<strong>The claim:</strong> "He was arrested for domestic violence" / "He's been to jail" / "He has a criminal record"

<strong>How to disprove:</strong> 
<li>Obtain a certified background check from your county courthouse</li>
<li>Request your criminal record from state law enforcement databases</li>
<li>If the claim references a specific incident, obtain police records showing no report was filed</li>
<li>Character references from law enforcement professionals you know personally</li>

<strong>Evidence strength:</strong> Very strong. Criminal records are verifiable public documents. The absence of a record directly contradicts claims about arrests or convictions.

<h3>Sexually Transmitted Disease Claims</h3>

<strong>The claim:</strong> "He gave me an STD" / "He has herpes" / "Get tested if you've been with him"

<strong>How to disprove:</strong>
<li>Obtain recent comprehensive STD test results from your healthcare provider</li>
<li>Request test results from the time period referenced in the post</li>
<li>Get a written statement from your physician confirming negative results</li>
<li>If the poster claims you transmitted something, their own medical records (obtainable through legal discovery) would need to confirm diagnosis and timeline</li>

<strong>Evidence strength:</strong> Very strong. Medical testing produces objective, verifiable results. False STD claims constitute defamation per se in most jurisdictions, meaning damages are presumed.

<h3>Infidelity or Relationship Claims</h3>

<strong>The claim:</strong> "He's married and on dating apps" / "He was cheating on me with five other women" / "He has a secret girlfriend"

<strong>How to disprove:</strong>
<li>Marriage records (or absence thereof) from county records</li>
<li>Relationship timeline documentation through text messages, social media posts, and witness testimony</li>
<li>Communication records showing you were single or that the relationship was not exclusive</li>
<li>Statements from people who can confirm your relationship status during the relevant period</li>

<strong>Evidence strength:</strong> Moderate to strong. Relationship status is verifiable, but claims about exclusivity agreements can become he-said/she-said disputes.

<h3>Behavioral or Character Claims</h3>

<strong>The claim:</strong> "He's emotionally abusive" / "He love-bombed me then ghosted" / "He's a narcissist"

<strong>How to disprove:</strong>
<li>Complete text message and communication history showing the actual dynamic</li>
<li>Witnesses who observed the relationship and can testify to your behavior</li>
<li>Evidence that the poster has a pattern of making similar claims about others</li>
<li>Professional character references</li>

<strong>Evidence strength:</strong> Moderate. Some of these claims border on protected opinion rather than verifiable fact. An attorney can evaluate which specific claims cross the line from opinion to actionable false statements.

<h3>Financial or Professional Claims</h3>

<strong>The claim:</strong> "He's broke and will try to take your money" / "He got fired for harassment" / "He lies about his job"

<strong>How to disprove:</strong>
<li>Employment verification from your employer (letter confirming position and standing)</li>
<li>Financial records demonstrating stability (used carefully — only share what's legally necessary)</li>
<li>Professional references and recommendations</li>
<li>Tax returns or pay stubs (in legal proceedings, not publicly shared)</li>

<strong>Evidence strength:</strong> Strong. Employment and financial claims are objectively verifiable through records.

<h2>Building Your Evidence File</h2>

<p>Create a comprehensive evidence package organized into these categories:</p>

<h3>Category 1: The Defamatory Content</h3>
<li>Screenshots of the original AWDTSG post with timestamps</li>
<li>Screenshots of all comments, especially those from the original poster</li>
<li>Screenshots of the poster's Facebook profile</li>
<li>Evidence of cross-platform spread (Reddit posts, Instagram screenshots, Google results)</li>
<li>Documentation of when you first discovered the post</li>

<h3>Category 2: Evidence of Falsity</h3>
<li>Medical records, police reports, employment verification, etc. that directly contradict claims</li>
<li>Organized by specific claim — each false statement paired with its contradicting evidence</li>
<li>Authenticated copies where possible (certified records carry more weight than screenshots)</li>

<h3>Category 3: Evidence of Damages</h3>
<li>Lost job opportunities (rejection emails referencing online content)</li>
<li>Lost dating matches (documented timeline of unmatches correlating with post timing)</li>
<li>Professional relationship changes (communications showing shift in treatment)</li>
<li>Emotional distress documentation (therapy records, medical records for anxiety/depression)</li>
<li>Financial losses attributable to the false claims</li>

<h3>Category 4: Evidence of Motive</h3>
<li>Prior relationship history with the poster (if applicable)</li>
<li>Communications showing <a href="/blog/revenge-posts-awdtsg-malicious-intent">revenge motivation</a></li>
<li>Evidence the poster has targeted others similarly</li>
<li>Context establishing why the poster would fabricate claims</li>

<h3>Category 5: Evidence of Spread</h3>
<li>Timeline of how content moved across platforms</li>
<li>Screenshots from each platform where content appeared</li>
<li>Google search results showing indexed content</li>
<li>Evidence of how many people viewed or engaged with the content</li>

<h2>The Legal Standard You Need to Meet</h2>

<p>Understanding the legal standard helps you evaluate whether your evidence is sufficient:</p>

<strong>Preponderance of the evidence</strong> is the standard in most civil defamation cases. This means you need to show it's "more likely than not" that the statements are false. You don't need to prove falsity beyond a reasonable doubt — that's the criminal standard and doesn't apply here.

<strong>Practical implication:</strong> If you have medical records showing you don't have the STD the poster claimed you transmitted, that alone likely satisfies the preponderance standard for that specific claim. Your evidence doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be more persuasive than the poster's unsupported claim.

<h2>When the Poster Is Unknown</h2>

<p>Many AWDTSG posts come from people you don't recognize or can't identify. This doesn't eliminate your options:</p>

<strong>Identifying the poster through legal discovery:</strong> Your attorney can file a "John Doe" lawsuit and subpoena Facebook for the poster's account information. Courts routinely grant these requests when the plaintiff demonstrates a prima facie defamation case. Facebook is required to provide identifying information including the email address, phone number, and IP addresses associated with the account.

<strong>Identifying through context clues:</strong> The poster's other public Facebook activity, mutual friends, group membership overlap, and details mentioned in the post itself can help narrow identification. Professional investigators experienced with social media can often identify anonymous posters through digital forensics.

<strong>Using removal services while identification proceeds:</strong> You don't need to identify the poster to achieve <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal</a>. Content can be eliminated regardless of who posted it. This allows you to stop the damage immediately while pursuing identification for potential legal claims in parallel.

<h2>Practical Steps to Take Today</h2>

<li><strong>Create a secure evidence folder.</strong> Use cloud storage with strong passwords. Back up to multiple locations. Evidence preservation is your first priority.</li>

<li><strong>Document the claims systematically.</strong> List every specific factual claim made in the post. Next to each claim, note what evidence you have or can obtain to disprove it.</li>

<li><strong>Obtain official records.</strong> Request certified copies of any records that contradict the false claims — medical tests, background checks, employment verification.</li>

<li><strong>Preserve all communications.</strong> If you have any prior communication with the poster, preserve it completely. Text messages, dating app conversations, emails, and social media interactions all become relevant evidence.</li>

<li><strong>Contact professional removal services.</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Tea App Green Flags</a> can begin removing the defamatory content while you build your evidence package. The sooner the content comes down, the less damage accumulates.</li>

<li><strong>Consult a defamation attorney.</strong> Bring your organized evidence package to an initial consultation. Most defamation attorneys offer free consultations and can quickly assess the strength of your potential case.</li>

<p>False accusations don't have to stand unchallenged. With systematic evidence collection and the right professional support, you can prove the truth and eliminate defamatory content from your digital presence.</p>
