        <p>Louisiana's vibrant social culture and legendary nightlife make the state's AWDTSG groups particularly active and dangerous. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. The New Orleans group alone has over 15,000 members, fueled by a dating scene that revolves around the French Quarter, the Warehouse District, Uptown bars, and the constant flow of festivals and events that define life in NOLA. A false post in a Louisiana AWDTSG group spreads through the state's interconnected social networks at a pace that matches Louisiana's famously lively culture.</p>

<p>If you've been falsely posted in a Louisiana AWDTSG group, your reputation is at risk across the state's tight social circles. Louisiana's unique legal system — based on civil law rather than common law — provides distinct tools for fighting defamation. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment. Professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Louisiana</h2>

<p>Louisiana's party culture and social connectivity drive high AWDTSG engagement across the state.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>New Orleans</strong> — Over 15,000 members covering the Crescent City including the French Quarter, Garden District, Uptown, Mid-City, Metairie, and the Northshore</li>
<li><strong>Baton Rouge</strong> — Large group serving the state capital and LSU community, one of the most active college dating scenes in the South</li>
<li><strong>Shreveport/Bossier City</strong> — Covering northwest Louisiana and Barksdale Air Force Base</li>
<li><strong>Lafayette</strong> — Serving Acadiana and the Cajun Country dating scene including UL Lafayette</li>
<li><strong>Lake Charles</strong> — Covering southwest Louisiana's casino and entertainment scene</li>
<li><strong>Monroe/West Monroe</strong> — Serving northeast Louisiana communities</li>
<li><strong>Houma/Thibodaux</strong> — Covering the Bayou region</li>

<p>New Orleans's unique social dynamics make its AWDTSG group exceptionally active. The city's dating scene is intensely social — built around bars, restaurants, festivals, and close-knit neighborhood communities. A post referencing someone seen at a Magazine Street bar or a Frenchmen Street venue is immediately recognizable to a large segment of the dating population.</p>

<p>The LSU Baton Rouge community generates massive AWDTSG engagement during football season and the academic year, with gameday social scenes driving post activity.</p>

<h2>Louisiana Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Louisiana's legal system is unique in the United States — based on civil law derived from the Napoleonic Code rather than English common law. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations. This creates distinct provisions for defamation that can be advantageous for removal.</p>

<strong>Louisiana Civil Code Article 2315</strong> provides the general framework for defamation as a tort, establishing that every act of a person that causes damage obligates the person by whose fault it occurred to repair it. This broad delictual framework covers defamation alongside other torts.

<p>Louisiana recognizes both defamation (the broad category) and distinguishes between statements that are <strong>defamatory per se</strong> and those requiring proof of special damages. Louisiana courts have recognized the following as per se defamatory:</p>

<li>Accusations of criminal conduct</li>
<li>Accusations of having a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Statements injurious to trade, business, or profession</li>
<li>Imputations of unchastity</li>

<p>Under Louisiana's per se doctrine, falsity, malice, and resulting injury are presumed.</p>

<p>The <strong>prescriptive period</strong> (Louisiana's equivalent of a statute of limitations) for defamation is <strong>one year</strong> under <strong>Louisiana Civil Code Article 3492</strong>. This shorter timeline demands prompt action.</p>

<strong><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=109423">Louisiana Revised Statutes § 14:47</strong> addresses criminal de</a>famation. Louisiana is one of the states that retains an active criminal defamation statute, making it a crime to make a false statement with malicious intent to cause injury. This criminal dimension adds significant weight to removal demands.

<strong>La. R.S. § 14:40.3</strong> covers cyberstalking in Louisiana, applicable to electronic communications used to harass or threaten. Coordinated AWDTSG campaigns may trigger this statute.

<p>Louisiana's <strong>right of privacy</strong> is recognized both through constitutional protections (Article I, Section 5 of the Louisiana Constitution) and through tort law, providing additional leverage for AWDTSG removal.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Louisiana</h2>

<p>Our Louisiana removal process accounts for the state's unique civil law system and the particular dynamics of Louisiana's social culture.</p>

<strong>Louisiana-Specific Legal Framework.</strong> Unlike other states, our Louisiana demands cite Civil Code articles rather than common law principles. We reference Art. 2315, per se categories, and criminal defamation under R.S. § 14:47.

<strong>NOLA Social Scene Awareness.</strong> We understand that New Orleans's tight social networks mean AWDTSG posts have outsized personal impact. Our assessment includes the offline social consequences unique to Louisiana's culture.

<strong>Multi-City Coordination.</strong> Posts spread between New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Lafayette groups frequently. We coordinate removal across all Louisiana groups simultaneously.

<strong>Platform Legal Engagement.</strong> Facebook's legal team reviews our Louisiana-specific demands, which cite the state's distinctive civil law framework. The combination of civil and criminal defamation provisions creates compelling removal justification.

<strong>Complete Cleanup.</strong> We handle Facebook removal, cross-platform tracking, Google deindexing, and monitoring for reposting. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<h2>Louisiana Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Under La. C.C. art. 2315, Louisiana provides a 1 year statute of limitations for defamation claims. Louisiana recognizes defamation under general standards, requiring proof of actual damages. Louisiana courts have jurisdiction over defamation claims filed in LA county courts where the plaintiff resides or where the defamatory content was published. Our legal documentation cites La. C.C. art. 2315 and applicable Louisiana case law to create effective leverage through Facebook's legal compliance channels.</p>
