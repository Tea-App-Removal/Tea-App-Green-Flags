        <p>Colorado's thriving dating scene — fueled by a young, active, transplant-heavy population — has made the state one of the most active AWDTSG markets in the Mountain West. The Denver AWDTSG group alone boasts over 24,000 members. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. When a false post appears in a Colorado group, it spreads through the state's tight social networks like wildfire, damaging your reputation with the outdoor-loving, socially connected community that defines life here.</p>

<p>If you've been falsely posted in a Colorado AWDTSG group, every day of inaction means more damage. Colorado law provides strong defamation protections, and professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Colorado</h2>

<p>Colorado's population boom over the past decade has driven massive growth in AWDTSG groups, particularly along the Front Range corridor where most residents live.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Denver</strong> — Over 24,000 members covering the Denver metro including Aurora, Lakewood, Littleton, Highlands Ranch, and the entire Front Range urban corridor</li>
<li><strong>Colorado Springs</strong> — Large and active group serving the state's second-largest city, including the military communities at Fort Carson, Peterson Space Force Base, and the Air Force Academy</li>
<li><strong>Boulder</strong> — Highly active group serving the University of Colorado community and Boulder's distinctive dating scene</li>
<li><strong>Fort Collins</strong> — Covering northern Colorado including Colorado State University and Loveland</li>
<li><strong>Pueblo</strong> — Serving southern Colorado communities</li>
<li><strong>Grand Junction</strong> — Covering the Western Slope region</li>
<li><strong>Durango</strong> — Serving the Four Corners area and the resort community</li>
<li><strong>Vail/Summit County</strong> — Seasonal group with high activity during ski season among resort workers and visitors</li>

<p>Colorado's outdoor culture creates unique AWDTSG dynamics. Men active in climbing, skiing, mountain biking, and trail running communities are particularly visible in AWDTSG groups because the outdoor community is interconnected and socially active. A post about someone in Denver's outdoor scene can reach climbers in Boulder, skiers in Vail, and runners in Colorado Springs within hours.</p>

<p>The military presence across Colorado — Fort Carson, Peterson, Schriever, Buckley, and the Air Force Academy — means a substantial portion of AWDTSG targets are service members facing additional career consequences from false accusations. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Colorado Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Colorado has 8 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 5.8M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Colorado Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Colorado's defamation framework provides meaningful protections for AWDTSG victims, with some unique features that strengthen removal efforts. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2023-title-13.pdf">Colorado Revised Statutes § 13-21-102</strong> governs defamatio</a>n actions in the state. Colorado recognizes both libel and slander, and AWDTSG Facebook posts constitute libel. The state follows the common law requirement of a false statement of fact, publication, fault, and damages.

<p>Colorado recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their business, trade, or profession</li>
<li>Impute sexual misconduct</li>

<p>Most AWDTSG posts fall into one or more of these categories, meaning damages are presumed without requiring proof of specific financial loss.</p>

<p>The statute of limitations for defamation in Colorado is <strong>one year</strong> under <strong>C.R.S. § 13-80-103</strong>. This shorter timeline makes rapid action critical for Colorado AWDTSG victims.</p>

<strong>Colorado's Criminal Libel statute (C.R.S. § 18-13-105)</strong> is notable — Colorado is one of the few states with an active criminal libel law. While prosecutions are rare, the existence of criminal liability for knowingly false and defamatory statements adds significant weight to removal demands.

<p>Colorado also provides protections under <strong>the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)</strong>, which took effect in 2023. This comprehensive privacy law gives Colorado residents rights over their personal data, including the right to deletion. AWDTSG posts sharing personal information, photos, and identifying details without consent may implicate CPA protections.</p>

<strong>C.R.S. § 18-9-111</strong> addresses harassment, including electronic harassment, which can apply to targeted AWDTSG campaigns and coordinated posting.

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Colorado</h2>

<p>Our Colorado removal process accounts for the state's active AWDTSG landscape and leverages Colorado's unique combination of defamation law, criminal libel statutes, and privacy protections.</p>

<strong>Front Range Coverage.</strong> We identify and track defamatory content across all Colorado AWDTSG groups, with particular focus on the interconnected Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins groups where cross-posting is frequent.

<strong>Multi-Statute Legal Strategy.</strong> Our legal demands cite C.R.S. § 13-21-102 for defamation, reference C.R.S. § 18-13-105 (criminal libel), and invoke Colorado Privacy Act protections. This comprehensive legal approach creates maximum pressure for removal.

<strong>Military-Sensitive Handling.</strong> For service members at Colorado installations, we understand the unique urgency related to security clearances, command climate, and career implications. We handle these cases with appropriate speed and discretion.

<strong>Platform Engagement.</strong> We submit removal demands through Facebook's legal channels with Colorado-specific legal citations. The combination of civil defamation, criminal libel potential, and CPA privacy rights creates compelling removal justification.

<strong>Outdoor and Social Community Monitoring.</strong> Given Colorado's interconnected outdoor and social communities, we monitor beyond standard platforms to catch AWDTSG content that spreads through community forums, meetup groups, and outdoor recreation platforms.

<p>Most Colorado removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>

<h2>Colorado's One-Year Clock Is Ticking</h2>

<p>With a one-year statute of limitations and the Denver group's 24,000+ members, delay is costly. Colorado's active, interconnected communities mean false AWDTSG accusations spread faster than in less socially connected states.</p>

<p>Professional removal through legal channels is proven to work. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get emergency AWDTSG removal in Colorado now</a>.</p>
