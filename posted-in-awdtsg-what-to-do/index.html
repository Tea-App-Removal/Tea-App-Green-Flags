Have someone screenshot the post, all comments, and the poster's profile. Do not engage with the post or contact the poster. Check for cross-platform spread by searching your name on Google, Reddit, and Instagram.

The lack of verification means the poster needs nothing more than your photo."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I delete my dating app profiles after being posted in AWDTSG?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not necessarily. Deleting profiles can make you harder to identify positively and doesn't address the AWDTSG content. However, you may want to temporarily pause your profiles while removal is underway. Professional removal services can advise on the best approach for your specific situation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can my employer find out about an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes.

        <p>You just found out. Maybe a friend texted you. Maybe a date suddenly went cold and told you why. Maybe you Googled yourself and saw something that made your blood run cold. Someone posted your name and photo in an "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group, and accusations are piling up.</p>

<p>Take a breath. This situation is serious, but it's manageable if you act correctly in the next few hours. What you do right now — and what you avoid doing — determines whether this stays a single post or becomes a months-long reputation crisis.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Do Not React Publicly</h2>

<p>This is the most important instruction in this entire guide. Your instinct right now is to fight back, defend yourself, or confront the poster. Suppress that instinct completely.</p>

<strong>Do not:</strong>
<li>Comment on the post (you likely can't access it anyway, but don't try)</li>
<li>Message the poster on Facebook, Instagram, or any other platform</li>
<li>Post about the situation on your own social media</li>
<li>Ask friends or family to defend you in the group</li>
<li>Create a fake profile to infiltrate the group</li>
<li>Contact the group admin without professional guidance</li>

<p>Every single one of these actions has a documented pattern of making situations worse. The group's social dynamics are designed to interpret male responses as confirmation of guilt. Your defense becomes the next viral post. Your anger becomes evidence of the "red flags" they warned about.</p>

<p>The people who achieve the best outcomes are those who stay silent publicly while taking strategic action behind the scenes.</p>

<h2>Don't Wait — Act Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up, more people see it.</strong> With 3.5 million members across all AWDTSG groups nationwide, exposure compounds fast. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a>. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment.


<h2>Step 2: Document Everything</h2>

<p>Evidence disappears. Posts get edited, comments get deleted, and posters sometimes remove content before you've captured it. You need documentation now, before anything changes.</p>

<strong>Have someone capture:</strong>
<li>The full original post (text, photos, timestamps)</li>
<li>All comments and replies</li>
<li>The poster's Facebook profile (name, profile picture, any public information)</li>
<li>The number of reactions and shares</li>
<li>Any tagged individuals or mentioned names</li>
<li>The group name and approximate member count</li>

<strong>How to capture this if you can't see the group:</strong>
<li>Ask a trusted female friend or family member who is a group member or can join</li>
<li>If you received screenshots from someone, save them in multiple locations (cloud storage, email to yourself, external drive)</li>
<li>Screen-record any content that might be temporary (Instagram Stories, etc.)</li>

<strong>Expand your documentation to other platforms:</strong>
<li>Google your full name in quotes — screenshot any related results</li>
<li>Search Reddit for your name and any related AWDTSG content</li>
<li>Check Instagram using relevant hashtags and location tags</li>
<li>Search Twitter/X for your name</li>
<li>Check Tea App for any reviews mentioning you</li>

<p>This documentation serves three purposes: it helps professional removal services understand the full scope, it preserves evidence for potential legal action, and it gives you a clear picture of how far the content has spread.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Assess the Damage Scope</h2>

<p>Not all AWDTSG posts are created equal. A post with three comments in a 5,000-member group requires a different response than a post with 400 comments in a 164,000-member group. Understanding the scope helps you choose the right response.</p>

<strong>Low severity (act within days):</strong>
<li>Post has fewer than 20 comments</li>
<li>No evidence of screenshot sharing</li>
<li>Small or medium-sized group (under 15,000 members)</li>
<li>Post is purely opinion-based with no false factual claims</li>
<li>No search engine results when you Google yourself</li>

<strong>Medium severity (act within 24 hours):</strong>
<li>Post has 20-100 comments</li>
<li>Screenshots have appeared on one or two other platforms</li>
<li>Group has 15,000-50,000 members</li>
<li>Post contains some false factual claims</li>
<li>Limited search engine visibility</li>

<strong>High severity (act immediately):</strong>
<li>Post has 100+ comments</li>
<li>Screenshots are spreading across multiple platforms</li>
<li>Group has 50,000+ members</li>
<li>Post contains serious false accusations (criminal behavior, STDs, abuse)</li>
<li>Content appears in Google search results for your name</li>
<li>Professional contacts or employers have been exposed to the content</li>

<p>Regardless of severity level, <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> are the most effective response. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content. The difference is urgency — high-severity situations require immediate professional engagement to prevent cascading damage.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Understand What Was Said</h2>

<p>The nature of the claims determines your options. Have someone relay the exact content of the post to you so you can assess it clearly.</p>

<strong>If the post contains false statements of fact</strong> (accusations of criminal behavior, claims about STDs, fabricated stories about specific events): You have strong grounds for both professional removal and potential <a href="/blog/awdtsg-defamation-legal-rights">legal action</a>. These posts are the most damaging but also the most defensible.

<strong>If the post contains opinions and vague warnings</strong> ("bad vibes," "I didn't feel safe," "trust your gut"): Pure opinions are harder to challenge legally, but professional removal services still achieve high success rates. These posts tend to generate less viral engagement than specific accusations.

<strong>If the post is a mix of both:</strong> This is the most common scenario. Posts that blend real opinions with fabricated facts. The false factual claims give you leverage for removal while the opinion portions make the post feel more credible to readers.

<strong>If you genuinely don't know the poster:</strong> Cases of mistaken identity, secondhand rumors, and posts by strangers happen regularly. Document that you have no connection to the poster — this strengthens both removal requests and legal claims.

<h2>Step 5: Lock Down Your Digital Presence</h2>

<p>While you work on removal, minimize the additional damage that can come from people investigating you after seeing the AWDTSG post.</p>

<strong>Privacy settings review:</strong>
<li>Set all personal social media profiles to private or friends-only</li>
<li>Remove or hide posts that could be taken out of context</li>
<li>Disable the ability for non-friends to see your friends list</li>
<li>Review tagged photos and remove tags in anything potentially misinterpretable</li>

<strong>Dating app adjustments:</strong>
<li>Consider temporarily pausing (not deleting) your dating profiles</li>
<li>If you keep them active, be aware that matches may have seen the AWDTSG post</li>
<li>Do not reference the AWDTSG situation in your dating profiles</li>

<strong>Professional presence:</strong>
<li>Google your name and review what appears</li>
<li>Check that your LinkedIn and professional profiles present well</li>
<li>If the AWDTSG content appears in professional search results, this is an urgent removal priority — read about <a href="/blog/awdtsg-career-professional-damage">career impacts</a></li>

<h2>Step 6: Contact Professional Help</h2>

<p>You've documented the situation, assessed the scope, and secured your digital presence. Now it's time to engage professionals who specialize in exactly this scenario.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Tea App Green Flags</a> offers free consultations for AWDTSG post removal. During the consultation, you'll discuss:

<li>The full scope of the post and any cross-platform spread</li>
<li>The nature of the claims and their accuracy</li>
<li>Your specific goals (removal, legal action, or both)</li>
<li>Timeline and process for professional removal</li>
<li>Whether <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App content</a> also needs to be addressed</li>

<p>Professional services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates for AWDTSG post removal, typically completing the process within 30 to 90 days. The sooner you engage, the less cross-platform spread needs to be addressed.</p>

<h2>Step 7: Consider Legal Consultation</h2>

<p>Depending on the severity and nature of the claims, legal action may be appropriate in addition to professional removal. This is especially true if:</p>

<li>The post contains demonstrably false accusations of criminal conduct</li>
<li>You can identify the poster</li>
<li>You've suffered quantifiable damages (lost job, lost business, etc.)</li>
<li>The poster has a pattern of making false claims</li>
<li>You want to pursue damages beyond just content removal</li>

<p>Many defamation attorneys offer free initial consultations. Read our <a href="/blog/awdtsg-lawsuit-guide">AWDTSG lawsuit guide</a> for detailed information about when legal action makes sense and what to expect from the process.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes That Make Everything Worse</h2>

<p>Learning from others' experience can save you from compounding an already difficult situation:</p>

<strong>Trying to infiltrate the group:</strong> Creating a fake female profile to access the AWDTSG group is one of the most common mistakes. Group admins are experienced at detecting fake profiles, and being caught infiltrating becomes its own post — validating every accusation and creating a fresh wave of content.

<strong>Having a friend "defend" you:</strong> When a woman in the group defends a posted man, she faces immediate backlash. The group accuses her of being a "pick me," questions her judgment, and sometimes posts about her relationship with the man. Your defender ends up attacked, and the original post gets more engagement.

<strong>Posting a rebuttal on social media:</strong> A public statement acknowledging the AWDTSG post amplifies it. People who hadn't seen the original post now search for it. Your rebuttal gets screenshotted and shared back into the group as evidence that you're "trying to control the narrative."

<strong>Threatening the poster:</strong> Legal threats made directly by you (rather than through an attorney) are rarely taken seriously and often get screenshotted and shared. They can also be characterized as harassment or intimidation, further damaging your position.

<strong>Waiting and hoping it goes away:</strong> AWDTSG posts don't expire or disappear. They remain in the group indefinitely, get resurfaced when someone new searches your name, and continue spreading to new platforms over time. Inaction is not a strategy — it's surrender.

<h2>Your Next Forty-Eight Hours</h2>

<p>If you're reading this within the first forty-eight hours of discovering your post, here's your condensed action plan:</p>

<strong>Hours 0-2:</strong> Document everything. Screenshot all content. Do not engage.

<strong>Hours 2-6:</strong> Assess the scope. Check all platforms. Lock down your digital presence.

<strong>Hours 6-12:</strong> <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services</a> for a free consultation. Provide your documentation.

<strong>Hours 12-48:</strong> Begin professional removal process. Consider legal consultation if claims are severe. Continue monitoring for new spread.

<p>For a more detailed timeline, read our <a href="/blog/posted-in-awdtsg-first-48-hours">first 48 hours checklist</a>.</p>

<p>The situation you're in right now feels overwhelming. It's supposed to feel that way — the emotional impact is part of what makes AWDTSG posts so effective as weapons. But this is a solvable problem. Professional removal works. Your reputation can be restored. Start by taking the right steps today.</p>
