        <p>You found out through a coworker who heard it from her roommate. Someone posted you in the Boston "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group. Your photo from Hinge, your first name, and a story that has nothing to do with reality. Women in Back Bay, South Boston, and Cambridge are reading it right now — commenting, sharing screenshots, and forming opinions about you based on accusations that are completely fabricated. In Boston, where social circles are tight and everyone's connected through school, work, or the local bar scene, this kind of post doesn't stay in one group. It goes everywhere.</p>

<p>Boston is a small big city. Your dating life, your professional reputation, and your social standing are separated by maybe two degrees. A false AWDTSG post collapses all three at once.</p>

<h2>The Boston AWDTSG Group</h2>

<p>The "Are We Dating The Same Guy Boston" Facebook group has over <strong>25,000 members</strong> and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts, comment, or request removal. The group is at <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/925125691951146/">facebook.com/groups/925125691951146/</a>. All content is subject to <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a> and their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

<p>This group has 25,000+ members and is restricted to women only. Men cannot view posts or request removal directly.</p>

<p>Boston's AWDTSG group is disproportionately influential for its size. The city's dense concentration of universities, hospitals, and professional firms creates a dating pool where people know each other through multiple overlapping channels. Women in Beacon Hill, the Seaport, Brookline, and Somerville all participate in the same group. With Hinge, Bumble, and The League dominating Boston's dating app landscape, AWDTSG has become the unofficial pre-date screening tool.</p>

<p>The Boston group's engagement rate is high because the city is small enough that posts frequently involve men who multiple women in the group have actually matched with or dated. This creates intense, personal engagement that goes far beyond casual browsing.</p>

<h2>Take Action Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Every hour your post stays up in the Boston AWDTSG group, more people see it.</strong> With 38,000+ members, exposure compounds rapidly. Our team has helped over 1,000 men remove defamatory content with a 92-95% success rate. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get your free consultation now</a> — the sooner you act, the less damage you'll face.


<h2>How Posts Spread in Boston</h2>

<p>Boston is notoriously interconnected. The city's combination of elite universities, teaching hospitals, financial firms, and tech companies creates social networks that overlap at every level. A post in the Boston AWDTSG group doesn't spread randomly — it spreads through specific, identifiable channels that reach your actual world.</p>

<p>How AWDTSG posts typically spread in Boston:</p>

<li><strong>Alumni networks</strong> — Boston's massive university population (Harvard, MIT, BU, BC, Northeastern, Tufts) means posts spread through alumni group chats and social circles</li>
<li><strong>Hospital and medical community gossip</strong> — Boston's Longwood Medical Area and major hospital systems create tight professional-social networks</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> reach the city's young professional demographic quickly</li>
<li><strong>Cross-posting to Providence, Worcester, and New Hampshire groups</strong> — New England's dating market is interconnected, with Boston as the hub</li>
<li><strong>Bar and restaurant scene</strong> — Boston's neighborhood bars in South Boston, the North End, and Allston are where people talk, and AWDTSG posts become conversation</li>

<p>Boston's "six degrees" is more like two degrees. The woman who read the AWDTSG post about you this morning might be your colleague's girlfriend, your roommate's friend, or someone you'll sit next to at a Red Sox game this weekend. The social proximity in Boston makes false AWDTSG posts uniquely damaging.</p>

<h2>Massachusetts Defamation Laws and Your Rights</h2>

<p>Massachusetts provides strong legal protections against defamation under common law principles and specific statutes.</p>

<p>Key aspects of <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter231/Section92">Massachusetts defamation law</a> for Boston residents:</p>

<li><strong>Defamation per se</strong> in Massachusetts covers false statements imputing criminal conduct, a loathsome disease, harm to business or profession, or unchastity — no special damages required</li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts statute of limitations</strong> for defamation is three years — significantly longer than most states</li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts courts</strong> have recognized online defamation, including social media posts, as actionable</li>
<li><strong>General damages</strong> including emotional distress and reputational harm are available without proving specific financial losses in per se cases</li>
<li><strong>Massachusetts does not have an anti-SLAPP statute</strong> that would obstruct legitimate defamation claims</li>

<p>Massachusetts's three-year statute of limitations and lack of anti-SLAPP hurdles give <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional removal services</a> strong leverage when pursuing removal through Facebook's legal channels for Boston clients. If you're struggling, resources like the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> (call or text 988) provide free, confidential support.</p>

<h2>Professional Removal for Boston AWDTSG Posts</h2>

<p>Standard Facebook reporting is useless for Boston AWDTSG posts. The group admins reject removal requests, automated systems don't flag the posts, and any direct contact with the poster triggers a follow-up post that doubles your exposure. In Boston's small social world, even having a friend try to intervene can backfire spectacularly.</p>

<a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Professional Facebook defamation removal</a> handles Boston cases with a New England-specific approach:

<strong>Regional Assessment</strong> — We identify every instance of the post across the Boston AWDTSG group, New England-area groups (Providence, Worcester, New Hampshire), Instagram reposts, Reddit threads, and Google search results.

<strong>Massachusetts Legal Documentation</strong> — We prepare formal notices citing Massachusetts defamation law, with its favorable three-year statute of limitations, and submit through Facebook's legal compliance channels.

<strong>Multi-Platform Cleanup</strong> — We address the original post, all cross-platform spread through Instagram, Reddit, and university/professional networks, and search engine indexing.

<strong>Ongoing Boston Monitoring</strong> — After removal, we watch the Boston AWDTSG group and New England groups for reposting attempts.

<p>Boston removals typically complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at a <strong>92-95% success rate</strong>. Given Boston's extremely tight social networks, the difference between acting on day one versus day seven can mean the difference between a contained situation and a citywide reputation crisis.</p>

<p>For content on <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Tea App or similar platforms</a>, we handle all removals as part of one coordinated strategy.</p>

<h2>Boston Is Too Small to Wait</h2>

<p>In a city with 25,000+ AWDTSG members and social circles that overlap at every turn, time is the most critical factor. Every day the post stays active in the Boston group, it reaches deeper into the networks that actually matter to you — your professional contacts, your social circle, your neighborhood. Boston doesn't give you the luxury of anonymity.</p>

<p>If you've been posted in the Boston "Are We Dating The Same Guy" group:</p>

<li><strong>Have someone screenshot everything</strong> — The post, all comments, and the poster's profile, before anything is edited or removed</li>
<li><strong>Do not reach out to the poster or have anyone advocate for you in the group</strong> — Boston is too small for this not to come back to you</li>
<li><strong>Be aware of your professional exposure</strong> — If you work in healthcare, finance, academia, or tech in Boston, the crossover to professional reputation is almost guaranteed</li>
<li><strong><a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Contact professional removal services immediately</a></strong> — In a city this interconnected, early action isn't optional — it's essential</li>

<p>Your reputation in Boston matters more than you think. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Get professional AWDTSG removal started now</a>.</p>
