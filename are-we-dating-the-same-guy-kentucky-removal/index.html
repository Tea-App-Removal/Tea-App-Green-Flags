        <p>Kentucky's strong sense of community and Southern tradition make reputation deeply personal. When a false post surfaces in a Kentucky "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group, it doesn't stay on a screen — it becomes part of the local conversation at work, at church, and at social gatherings. The Louisville AWDTSG group has over 7,000 members, and active groups across the Bluegrass State mean false accusations can follow you from the Derby City to the Bourbon Trail. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">Pew Research Center</a>, 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of online harassment. These groups operate under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>, though enforcement is inconsistent.</p>

<p>If you've been falsely posted in a Kentucky AWDTSG group, the close-knit nature of Kentucky communities means the damage is personal and immediate. Professional removal services achieve ninety-two to ninety-five percent success rates.</p>

<h2>AWDTSG Groups Across Kentucky</h2>

<p>Kentucky's AWDTSG groups cover the state's major metro areas, with Louisville and Lexington anchoring the network.</p>

<p>Active AWDTSG groups currently operate in:</p>

<li><strong>Louisville</strong> — Over 7,000 members covering the Louisville metro including the Highlands, NuLu, St. Matthews, Jeffersontown, and Southern Indiana dating spillover</li>
<li><strong>Lexington</strong> — Active group covering the Bluegrass region including the University of Kentucky community, Georgetown, and Richmond</li>
<li><strong>Northern Kentucky</strong> — Overlapping significantly with Cincinnati's 13,000+ member AWDTSG group, covering Covington, Newport, Florence, and the Greater Cincinnati dating scene</li>
<li><strong>Bowling Green</strong> — Serving south-central Kentucky and the Western Kentucky University community</li>
<li><strong>Owensboro</strong> — Covering the western Kentucky region</li>
<li><strong>Fort Campbell Area</strong> — Serving the military community straddling the Kentucky-Tennessee border</li>
<li><strong>Ashland/Huntington</strong> — Cross-border group serving the Tri-State area of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio</li>

<p>Louisville's Highlands and NuLu neighborhoods anchor the city's dating scene, and AWDTSG posts frequently reference these specific social areas. The Derby season brings heightened social activity and corresponding AWDTSG group engagement.</p>

<p>Northern Kentucky's overlap with Cincinnati creates major cross-state exposure. A post about someone in Covington or Newport reaches Cincinnati's much larger 13,000+ member group immediately.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Kentucky Reputation Now</h2>

<strong>⚠️ Kentucky has 6 active AWDTSG groups and growing.</strong> Every hour your post stays visible, more people see it across the state's 4.5M population. We've achieved a 92-95% success rate across 1,000+ removals nationwide. <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">Start your free consultation today</a>.


<h2>Kentucky Defamation and Privacy Laws</h2>

<p>Kentucky provides strong defamation protections with both statutory provisions and well-developed case law. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-consumer-protection">FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection</a> provides additional resources for consumers facing online fraud and privacy violations.</p>

<strong>Kentucky Revised Statutes § 411.051 through § 411.061</strong> governs defamation in Kentucky. The state recognizes both libel and slander, with AWDTSG Facebook posts constituting libel.

<p>Kentucky recognizes <strong>defamation per se</strong> for false statements that:</p>

<li>Impute criminal conduct</li>
<li>Impute a loathsome disease</li>
<li>Injure someone in their business, trade, or profession</li>
<li>Impute serious sexual misconduct or unchastity</li>

<p>Under per se treatment, general damages are presumed without requiring proof of specific financial loss.</p>

<p>The statute of limitations for defamation in Kentucky is <strong>one year</strong> under <strong>KRS § 413.140(1)(d)</strong>. This is one of the shortest in the country, making immediate action essential for Kentucky AWDTSG victims.</p>

<strong>KRS § 525.080</strong> addresses harassment in Kentucky, including communications through electronic means. Targeted AWDTSG posting campaigns may constitute harassment under this statute.

<strong>KRS § 508.130 through § 508.150</strong> covers stalking, including electronic monitoring and communication. Persistent AWDTSG targeting can constitute stalking under Kentucky law.

<p>Kentucky's <strong>right of publicity law (KRS § 391.170)</strong> protects against unauthorized use of a person's name or likeness for commercial advantage. While AWDTSG posts aren't overtly commercial, the statute may provide additional leverage in certain circumstances.</p>

<h2>How We Remove AWDTSG Posts in Kentucky</h2>

<p>Our Kentucky removal process leverages the state's per se categories and addresses the critical NKY-Cincinnati crossover.</p>

<strong>Kentucky-Ohio Coordination.</strong> The Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati overlap requires simultaneous removal from both state's groups. We handle this cross-border complexity seamlessly.

<strong>Kentucky Legal Documentation.</strong> Our demands cite <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=51192">KRS § 411.051</a> and applicable per se categories. Kentucky's one-year statute of limitations creates urgency that we leverage in removal negotiations.

<strong>Military Community Handling.</strong> Fort Campbell personnel face unique dual-state complications (Kentucky-Tennessee) and military career consequences. We provide expedited, discreet service.

<strong>Community-Sensitive Approach.</strong> We understand Kentucky's community dynamics and the outsized local impact of AWDTSG posts in medium-sized cities and university towns.

<strong>Full Platform Cleanup.</strong> Facebook removal, screenshot tracking, Google deindexing, and ongoing monitoring. Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456">content removal request tool</a> for certain types of harmful content.

<p>Most Kentucky removals complete within <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> at ninety-two to ninety-five percent success.</p>
