In states with strong anti-SLAPP statutes like California, New York, and Texas, courts have increasingly ruled that AWDTSG posts constitute speech on matters of public interest. The Murray v. Valdes decision in California set a precedent that AWDTSG posts are analogous to consumer reviews. Dismissal risk is highest in the 33 states with anti-SLAPP laws."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What states have anti-SLAPP laws that affect AWDTSG lawsuits?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As of 2026, 33 states plus D.C. have anti-SLAPP laws. Strong anti-SLAPP states where dismissal is most likely include California, New York, Texas, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and Connecticut. States with no or weak anti-SLAPP laws include Alabama, Iowa, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I have to pay the defendants legal fees if my AWDTSG lawsuit is dismissed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In most states with strong anti-SLAPP statutes, yes. Mandatory fee-shifting provisions require the dismissed plaintiff to pay the defendants attorney fees and costs. In the Murray v. Valdes case, the plaintiff spent $27,000 on his own legal fees and was ordered to pay $18,000 in defendant fees, totaling $45,000 with no content removal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is professional removal faster than suing over an AWDTSG post?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Significantly faster. Professional removal through Tea App Green Flags achieves 92-95% success rates in 10-18 business days. AWDTSG defamation lawsuits take 8-24 months, cost $15,000-$100,000+, and face increasing dismissal rates due to anti-SLAPP motions. The defamatory post remains online throughout litigation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What legal strategies still work for AWDTSG defamation cases?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Strategic jurisdiction selection in states without strong anti-SLAPP laws, pre-suit demand letters with specific evidence of falsity (35-45% compliance rate), claims targeting provably false factual statements rather than opinions, and alternative torts like invasion of privacy or intentional infliction of emotional distress that may resist anti-SLAPP motions.

        <p>In March 2025, a software engineer in Southern California hired a defamation attorney after discovering a lengthy post about him in the "Are We Dating the Same Guy - Los Angeles" Facebook group. All AWDTSG posts fall under <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Facebook's Community Standards</a>, including their <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/bullying-harassment/">Bullying and Harassment Policy</a>. The post accused him of being emotionally abusive, secretly recording intimate encounters, and lying about his marital status. Every claim was false, and he had text messages and other evidence to prove it. His attorney filed a defamation lawsuit against the woman who wrote the post. Five months and $27,000 in legal fees later, the case was dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute. The judge ruled that the Facebook post constituted speech on a matter of public interest, that the group served as a public forum for consumer-like reviews of dating partners, and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a probability of prevailing on his claims at the early stage required by the anti-SLAPP motion. To add insult to the financial injury, the judge ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney's fees of $18,000 under the mandatory fee-shifting provision of California's anti-SLAPP law. Total cost: $45,000 and no removal.</p>

<p>That outcome is not an anomaly. It is becoming the standard result for AWDTSG defamation lawsuits filed in states with strong anti-SLAPP statutes. If you are considering suing someone who posted about you in an "Are We Dating the Same Guy" group, you need to understand the anti-SLAPP landscape before you spend a dollar on legal fees. The rules have changed, and the strategies that might have worked three years ago are now failing with increasing consistency.</p>

<h2>What Anti-SLAPP Laws Actually Do</h2>

<p>SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. Anti-SLAPP statutes were originally designed to protect activists, journalists, and concerned citizens from being silenced by wealthy individuals or corporations who filed meritless lawsuits to punish people for speaking out. The concept is straightforward: if someone sues you for exercising your right to free speech on a matter of public concern, you can file an anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss the case at an early stage, before the expensive discovery phase.</p>

<p>The defendant files an anti-SLAPP motion shortly after being served. The court evaluates two questions: does the speech relate to a matter of public interest, and has the plaintiff demonstrated a probability of prevailing?</p>

<p>The critical point is the burden shift. Once the defendant establishes that their speech touches a public interest, the plaintiff must demonstrate, at this early stage and without discovery, a reasonable probability of winning. This is a substantially higher bar than surviving a standard motion to dismiss. The plaintiff needs admissible evidence, not just allegations, showing the statements were false, defamatory, and caused damages.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the case is dismissed. And in most states with anti-SLAPP laws, the dismissed plaintiff must pay the defendant's attorney's fees and costs. This fee-shifting provision is what transforms an anti-SLAPP motion from a procedural inconvenience into a financial catastrophe for plaintiffs.</p>

<h2>The Murray v. Valdes Decision and Its Impact</h2>

<p>The case that changed the landscape for AWDTSG lawsuits is Murray v. Valdes, decided by a California appellate court in 2025. While the specific facts have been anonymized in public reporting, the legal reasoning set a precedent that has been cited in nearly every subsequent AWDTSG anti-SLAPP motion in California.</p>

<p>The court held that posts in "Are We Dating the Same Guy" groups constitute speech on a matter of public interest under California's anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16). The reasoning was multifaceted. The groups have large memberships (tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of members), making the speech a form of communication in a public forum. The subject matter, warning others about potentially dangerous dating partners, relates to public safety. And the activity is analogous to consumer reviews, which courts have consistently protected under anti-SLAPP.</p>

<p>The court explicitly rejected the argument that AWDTSG posts are purely private matters between two individuals. It reasoned that by posting in a group with 80,000 members, the poster was engaging in a form of public communication about a matter that the group's membership, by virtue of joining, had collectively identified as being of public concern.</p>

<p>The D'Ambrosio case, decided later in 2025 in New York, reached a similar conclusion under New York's anti-SLAPP statute (Civil Rights Law Sections 70-a and 76-a), which was significantly strengthened in 2020. The court found that AWDTSG posts met the broad definition of "public petition and participation" and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated actual malice, which New York's amended statute requires for cases involving public interest speech.</p>

<p>These two decisions, from the two most populous states in the country, created a framework that defense attorneys in AWDTSG cases now cite as established precedent. While neither decision is binding outside its own jurisdiction, the reasoning has been influential in other states' courts.</p>

<h2>Which States Have Anti-SLAPP Laws (and How Strong They Are)</h2>

<p>Not all anti-SLAPP statutes are created equal. As of early 2026, 33 states and the District of Columbia have some form of anti-SLAPP law, but they vary dramatically in scope and strength.</p>

<strong>Strong anti-SLAPP states</strong> where AWDTSG lawsuit dismissal is most likely include California, New York, Texas, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Connecticut, and the District of Columbia. These states have broad definitions of protected speech, early-stage dismissal mechanisms, and mandatory fee-shifting. Filing here means significant odds of dismissal and fee liability.

<strong>Moderate anti-SLAPP states</strong> include Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Virginia, where narrower definitions and more limited fee-shifting make outcomes less predictable.

<strong>Weak or no anti-SLAPP states</strong> include Alabama, Iowa, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. Filing in these states avoids the anti-SLAPP trap but still faces all other challenges of defamation litigation.

<p>There is no federal anti-SLAPP statute. If you file in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, the applicability of state anti-SLAPP law depends on the circuit, adding another layer of uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Why AWDTSG Lawsuits Fail Even Without Anti-SLAPP</h2>

<p>Anti-SLAPP is the most immediate threat to AWDTSG lawsuits, but it is not the only reason these cases frequently fail. Several other factors work against plaintiffs independently of anti-SLAPP motions.</p>

<strong>The opinion defense.</strong> Many AWDTSG posts are carefully worded to frame claims as personal experiences or opinions rather than statements of fact. "He made me feel unsafe" is an opinion. "He's a narcissist" is arguably a subjective characterization rather than a falsifiable claim. Defense attorneys parse posts sentence by sentence, arguing that each individual statement is either protected opinion, rhetorical hyperbole, or a non-actionable generalization. Courts have historically been receptive to these arguments in the online speech context.

<strong>Anonymous posting complications.</strong> Many AWDTSG posts are made by members using accounts with limited identifying information. While it's usually possible to identify the poster through legal discovery, the process adds months and thousands of dollars to the litigation before you even get to the merits of the defamation claim. We've seen cases where the identification process revealed the poster was in a different state than expected, requiring the plaintiff to refile in a different jurisdiction.

<strong>Section 230 blocks claims against Facebook.</strong> You cannot sue Meta for hosting AWDTSG content. Section 230 immunity means your lawsuit must target the individual poster, and even a win doesn't automatically remove the content from the platform.

<strong>Damages are difficult to quantify.</strong> AWDTSG damages are largely reputational and emotional, both difficult to translate into dollar amounts that justify litigation costs unless you can point to concrete financial harm.

<strong>The Streisand Effect.</strong> Filing a public lawsuit can draw more attention to the allegations than the post itself. Court filings are public records. We've seen cases where the lawsuit generated more Google search results than the underlying post ever did.

<h2>Legal Strategies That Still Work</h2>

<p>Despite the challenges, there are legal approaches that produce results for AWDTSG defamation victims. The key is choosing the right strategy for your specific situation and jurisdiction.</p>

<strong>Strategic jurisdiction selection.</strong> If you have a choice of where to file, such as when you live in one state and the poster lives in another, selecting a jurisdiction without a strong anti-SLAPP statute can dramatically change your odds. Filing in Ohio, for example, avoids the anti-SLAPP trap entirely. This requires careful analysis of personal jurisdiction rules and long-arm statutes, but strategic forum selection is one of the most impactful decisions in AWDTSG litigation.

<strong>Pre-suit demand letters with teeth.</strong> A carefully drafted cease and desist letter, one that cites specific false statements, attaches evidence of falsity, references the applicable state defamation statute, and outlines potential damages, produces voluntary removal in roughly 35-45% of cases. The letter is less expensive than a lawsuit ($500 to $2,000 for attorney preparation) and doesn't create the public record or Streisand Effect risks of filing suit. It also preserves your litigation options if the poster doesn't comply.

<strong>Targeted claims that survive anti-SLAPP.</strong> Even in strong anti-SLAPP states, some claims survive the motion if the plaintiff can present sufficient evidence at the early stage. Specific factual claims that are provably false (like "he has a criminal record" when he doesn't, or "he gave me an STD" when medical evidence contradicts this) are harder for defendants to characterize as protected opinion. Building a strong evidentiary record before filing, rather than relying on discovery to develop your case, is essential in anti-SLAPP jurisdictions.

<strong>Invasion of privacy and related torts.</strong> Defamation isn't the only legal theory available. Depending on the content of the post and your jurisdiction, claims for false light invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with business relationships, or cyberstalking may be viable. Some of these claims are less susceptible to anti-SLAPP motions than defamation because they involve different elements and may not be categorized as "speech" for anti-SLAPP purposes.

<h2>Professional Removal: The Faster Alternative to Litigation</h2>

<p>For most people who discover defamatory posts about themselves in AWDTSG groups, the primary goal is getting the content removed, not winning a legal judgment. If that describes your situation, <a href="/facebook-defamation-post-removal">professional Facebook defamation removal</a> achieves that goal faster, cheaper, and more reliably than litigation.</p>

<p>Professional removal services operate through legal and compliance channels that engage directly with Facebook's trust and safety infrastructure. The documentation submitted through these channels includes legally substantiated defamation analyses, evidence of falsity, and formal notices that create liability exposure for the platform. This is fundamentally different from the standard user reporting process, which routes through content moderation AI that evaluates against community guidelines rather than legal standards.</p>

<p>The numbers tell the story. Professional AWDTSG post removal services achieve 92-95% success rates with average completion times of 10 to 18 business days. Compare that to defamation lawsuits, which take 8 to 24 months, cost $15,000 to $100,000, and face increasing dismissal rates due to anti-SLAPP motions. Professional removal costs a fraction of litigation and delivers results in weeks rather than months or years.</p>

<p>Professional services also address the multi-platform problem that lawsuits cannot. A defamation judgment against one poster in one state court does nothing about screenshots shared to Instagram, cross-posts to Tea App, or cached content in Google search results. <a href="/tea-app-defamation-post-removal">Comprehensive removal services</a> coordinate takedowns across all platforms where content has appeared, providing complete resolution rather than the partial remedy a lawsuit might eventually deliver.</p>

<p>For situations where AWDTSG content has spread to Tea App specifically, <a href="/tea-on-her-defamation-negative-post-removal">Tea App post removal services</a> use platform-specific expertise and established relationships with Tea App's compliance infrastructure to achieve removal through the most efficient available channels.</p>

<h2>The Hybrid Strategy: Removal Now, Legal Record Later</h2>

<p>The most effective approach for many AWDTSG victims combines professional removal for immediate results with targeted legal action to create a deterrent record.</p>

<p>Here is how the hybrid strategy works in practice. On day one, you engage a professional removal service to begin the content takedown process across all platforms. Within two to three weeks, the defamatory content is removed from Facebook, Tea App, Instagram, and any other platform where it appeared. This stops the bleeding. No more views, no more shares, no more damage accumulation.</p>

<p>Simultaneously or shortly after, your attorney sends a formal cease and desist letter to the identified poster. This letter serves two purposes. It puts the poster on legal notice that their conduct was defamatory, which deters reposting. And it creates a documented paper trail that strengthens your position if the poster tries again in the future. If the poster ignores the cease and desist and reposts, you now have evidence of willful and knowing defamation, which significantly strengthens a subsequent lawsuit and may satisfy even a strong anti-SLAPP jurisdiction's early-stage evidence requirements.</p>

<a href="/reputation-monitoring">Ongoing reputation monitoring</a> completes the hybrid strategy by providing real-time detection of new defamatory content. If the poster attempts to repost or creates new defamatory content, the monitoring system catches it within hours, triggering immediate removal action and providing timestamped evidence for potential legal proceedings.

<p>This approach gets you the immediate result you need (content removal) without the financial risk and timeline uncertainty of leading with litigation. It preserves your legal options while addressing the practical reality that most AWDTSG defamation situations are best resolved through removal rather than courtroom battles.</p>

<h2>What to Do Right Now If You're Considering a Lawsuit</h2>

<p>If you've found defamatory content about yourself in an AWDTSG group and you're considering legal action, here is the sequence of steps that will protect your interests regardless of which path you ultimately choose.</p>

<p>First, document everything: screenshots of the post and all comments, the group name and membership count, the poster's profile, and any evidence the claims are false. This documentation is essential regardless of which path you choose.</p>

<p>Second, research the anti-SLAPP law in the state where you would file. Strong anti-SLAPP states mean significant dismissal risk with potential fee liability.</p>

<p>Third, consult with a defamation attorney who has specific experience with social media cases and anti-SLAPP motions, not a general practitioner.</p>

<p>Fourth, get a parallel assessment from a <a href="/tea-app-removal-services">professional removal service</a>. Understanding the timeline, cost, and success probability of professional removal gives you a complete picture of your options before you commit to any single approach.</p>

<p>The worst outcome is spending $30,000 on a lawsuit that gets dismissed under anti-SLAPP while the defamatory content remains online the entire time. The best outcome is content removal within weeks, combined with a legal deterrent that prevents reposting. The difference between those two outcomes is the strategy you choose at the beginning, not the amount of money you throw at the problem.</p>

<p>You didn't choose to be posted about in an AWDTSG group. But you do get to choose how you respond. Choose strategically, not emotionally, and you'll be in a far stronger position to protect your reputation and your finances.</p>
